Turn the dough out onto a flat surface and roll it into a ball. Wrap it in plastic wrap and press it down. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.\nIn a medium saucepan, bring the milk to a simmer.

This tilting should cause the omelet to slide down in the pan a little. Using a heatproof spatula, fold the edge closest to you toward the center. Fold the other edge in toward the center and invert the pan over the center of a plate so the omelet lands seam-side down.
