Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Using a small glass or cookie cutter (1 1/4 to 1 1/2-inch wide), trace 15 circles on each piece of parchment paper, leaving about 2 inches between each round.

Pour the chocolate into the molds, filling them to the top. Set the sticks in place by inserting them just far enough to be secure within the mold you are using. Set the molds aside to allow the chocolate to set. When set, simply pop out the lollipops. If you are using molding compound, roll it into a 1/2-inch-thick rectangle on top of a sheet of parchment paper.

There are a variety of ways to temper. One of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate's residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer. Another way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk. The classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess. A simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes.", "ingredients": ["1 cup nuts, optional", "16 ounces bittersweet chocolate, tempered", "16 ounces white chocolate, tempered", "16 ounces milk chocolate, tempered", "Vegetable cooking spray"], "title": "Chocolate Lollipops", "picture_link": null}, "2026": {"instructions": "Yogurt-Dill Dip: Pulse 1 garlic clove, 1/4 cup each roughly chopped mint, dill and parsley, 1 chopped scallion and 1 chopped anchovy in a food processor.

But macarons are tres temperamental. These detailed directions - and practice - will guide you to macaron success. If your first batch is less than perfect, savor your macarons in all their crispy chewy glory, and try again.\nPosition an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Using a small glass or cookie cutter (1 1/4- to 1 1/2-inch wide), trace 15 circles on each piece of parchment, leaving about 2 inches between each round. Flip the parchment over; the lines will be visible through the paper but you will not have to pipe directly onto the ink. Fit a pastry bag with a round tip about 1/4 inch wide.\nSift the confectioners' sugar and ground almonds into a bowl and discard any larger nut chunks. (If you have more than a tablespoon of bigger chunks, grind those until powdery and then resift.) Combine the egg whites and salt in a large bowl and whip on medium-low speed with an electric mixer until frothy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the granulated sugar, increase the speed to medium-high and whip until very soft peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the almond extract and a few drops of food coloring (if using); a little goes a long way so add with caution. Whip until stiff peaks form, 3 to 5 minutes. Fold about one-third of the sugar-nut mixture into the egg whites until blended, and then carefully fold in the remaining two-thirds. The batter should be a bit fluid but not runny. It should slowly drip off the spatula and sit on top of the batter in the bowl for a bit before eventually oozing back into it. If it seems a bit stiff at this point, fold once or twice more until it relaxes, although be careful not to over-fold. This correct texture is the key to the macaron and it is better to have a stiffer batter than a looser one.\nTransfer the batter to the prepared pastry bag. Holding the bag perpendicular over the baking sheet, squeeze until the batter fills a circle drawn on the paper. Release the pressure on the bag and pull towards you to prevent a pointy tip on the center of the cookie. Repeat with the remaining circles.

Turn off the heat and let the cream sit for about an hour. Remove from the heat and store in an airtight container in the refrigerator overnight or up to 4 days.\nFor the fortune cookie: In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar and egg whites until combined. Whisk in the melted butter, then the flour and then the ginger (or extract or spice of your choice). Place the batter in an airtight container and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. (The batter will keep in the refrigerator for up to a week in an airtight container.)\nPreheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Line a very flat, level baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper, and liberally spray with nonstick cooking spray.\nSpoon about a tablespoon of batter onto the baking sheet and, using the back of the spoon or an offset spatula, carefully spread the batter into a circle 6 to 7 inches in diameter. Your first few times you should probably stick to making these one at a time but once you get the hang of it, try making 2 to 3 at a time. Bake until the tuile is completely golden brown all over, 12 to 14 minutes.\nAs soon as the tuile is done, remove it from the oven and immediately start to slide a spatula underneath the tuile to loosen it from the sheet. The tuile will go through several stages before it gets to its final cooled and crispy state. Directly out of the oven it is too hot and delicate to handle. After about 10 seconds it firms up enough to hold its shape so you can handle it and shape it. It stays pliable for 10 to 15 more seconds; this is your window of opportunity to work with the cookie. Once you've worked the spatula under the whole cookie, pick it up and shape into a fortune cookie. If you wait too long the cookie starts to harden and cool and then your attempt to shape it will result in a shattered mess. You can place the cookie back into the oven for a few seconds to re-warm it into a pliable state. However, with each reheating, the cookie cools down even faster so I recommend only 2 re-heatings. Use a new cool baking sheet for each batch or cool your baking sheet under cool water before reusing. If you try to spoon the batter onto a hot sheet it will immediately start to melt and become un-spreadable. Continue with all of the batter until you have 8 to 10 cookies. Let cool for 30 minutes. Cookies hold for about a day in an airtight container.\nTo assemble: When you are ready to serve the mousse, strain the ginger-flavored heavy cream into a large mixing bowl. Whip the cream until it holds a peak. Fold in the Lemon Curd. Divide into serving bowls and top with candied ginger and a fortune cookie.\nIn a medium, nonreactive saucepan, combine the lemon juice and butter, place over medium-high heat and heat to just under a boil. In a medium, heatproof bowl, whisk the eggs and egg yolks until blended, then slowly whisk in the sugar until combined. Remove the lemon juice mixture from the heat and gradually whisk a little of it into the sugar/egg mixture. Continue whisking the hot liquid into the sugar/egg mixture, a little at a time, until all of it has been incorporated. When all of the hot liquid has been incorporated, return the contents of the bowl to the saucepan and return the saucepan to medium heat. Cook, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon and making sure to scrape the bottom of the pan frequently to prevent the eggs from scrambling, for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the mixture thickens and coats the spoon thickly. To test, draw your finger along the back of the spoon; the curd should hold the trail for a second or two before it fills. Remove the curd from the heat and strain it through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Whisk in the vanilla and salt. You should have about 3 cups.
