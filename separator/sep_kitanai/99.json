Mix on medium speed for about 1 minute. Stop the mixer as soon as the ingredients begin to form a dough and pull away from the side of the bowl. If the dough appears too dry and does not come together, add the remaining water and mix just until combined. Do not over mix or you will over-develop the gluten. It is very important to keep gluten development to a minimum in this recipe, or the finished puff pastry will be tough and chewy instead of delicate and crispy. Remove the dough from the mixer and pat it into a 5-inch square about 2-inches thick. Wrap the dough completely in plastic and let it rest in the refrigerator for 2 hours. Resting the dough allows the gluten strands that have developed to relax.\nWork the cold butter into a square that is about a third smaller than the dough square, and about 1-inch thick. Place the butter on a lightly floured work surface and, keeping it square shaped, use a rolling pin to give it a few quick raps. This will soften the butter. It should be about the same consistency as the puff pastry dough. Lightly flour the butter and rolling pin as needed to keep it from sticking.\nRemove the dough from the refrigerator and place on a lightly floured work surface. Use the rolling pin to make a mark about 1-inch from each corner of the dough. Roll only this part of each corner away from the center of the dough until it is 1/4-inch thick. The center of the dough should be about 1-inch thick. Place the butter square in the center of the dough square. Pull the rolled-out corners up and over the butter, completely enclosing it in a dough package. When the butter has been added, the dough is referred to as a paton.\nThe paton is now ready to be folded. You will need to give the dough six single folds, allowing the dough to rest in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours after every 2 folds. To begin, use a rolling pin and roll the paton into a 10 by 23-inch rectangle. Try to keep it an even thickness. Place the dough horizontally in front of you so it will be easier to fold. Fold the dough in thirds by first folding the left end over the middle and then folding the right third over it. Rotate the dough to make sure the seam is on your right. This is known as a single fold, or a letter fold because it resembles the way a letter is folded. Repeat the single fold starting with a 10 by 23-inch rectangle placed horizontally in front of you. To show that you have folded the dough two times, make two indentations in the dough with your fingertips. At this stage, the puff pastry must be kept well wrapped in the refrigerator for a minimum of 2 hours or up to 1 day.\nRemove the dough from the refrigerator and give it the final two folds, starting each time with the 10 by 23-inch rectangle. Let the dough rest in the refrigerator for at least one hour before using. Then it will be ready to be rolled and formed into the shape required. The finished puff pastry will keep, well wrapped in plastic wrap, in the refrigerator for one day or in freezer for up to two months.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees F. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the puff pastry into a 6 by 12-inch rectangle 1/8-inch thick. Place on a parchment-lined sheet pan and place another sheet pan on top of it. Bake between the 2 sheet pans until it barely begins to take on color, about 10 minutes. The puff pastry may rise unevenly in sections. If that happens, release the air by gently piercing the dough with the tip of a paring knife. Mix the corn syrup and water together. Remove the puff pastry from the oven and brush the top with the corn syrup mixture. Cover with another sheet of parchment paper and flip over the puff pastry. Peel off the parchment paper that is now on top and brush this side with the corn syrup mixture.\nUsing a sharp paring knife and a plate as your guide, cut about a 10-inch circle from the half-baked puff pastry. Discard the excess dough. I cut the circles when the dough is half-baked so they will keep their shape. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Place the puff pastry circle back in the oven and continue to bake until crispy and golden brown, about another 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and place on a wire rack until completely cooled.\nFor the Chocolate Pastry Cream: Sift together the cornstarch and 1/4 cup of the sugar in a medium-sized mixing bowl. Add the egg yolks and whisk until well combined. Pour the milk and the remaining 1/4-cup sugar into a 2-quart saucepan and place the saucepan over medium-high heat. While the milk is heating, use a sharp knife to slice the vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Separate the seeds from the outside skin by scraping the blade of the knife along the inside of the bean. Add the seeds and the skin to the heating milk and bring to a boil.\nTemper the egg mixture with the hot milk by carefully pouring about half of the milk into the egg mixture. Immediately whisk to prevent the eggs from scrambling. Pour the tempered egg mixture into the saucepan and continue to whisk. Continuously whisk to ensure that the mixture cooks evenly. Once the pastry cream has come to a boil, continue to whisk and cook for another 2 minutes to fully develop the flavor of the pastry cream and to cook out the flavor of the starch. Remove the pan from the heat. Strain the pastry cream through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any pieces of cooked egg and the vanilla bean. If you would like to add butter, this is the time to do so. Add the bittersweet chocolate and stir until it is well incorporated. Pour the pastry cream into a clean, airtight container and place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of it to prevent a skin from forming. Let cool at room temperature, then store in the refrigerator for up to 2 to 3 days, until ready to use.\nFor the Pate a Choux: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place the water, salt, sugar, and butter into a 4-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. The butter should be completely melted by the time the mixture boils. Remove the saucepan from the heat, add the bread flour all at once, and incorporate it thoroughly with a wooden spatula.\nReturn the saucepan to the stove and cook over medium heat for about 3 minutes to dry out the paste. As it cooks, move the paste from side to side in the saucepan with the wooden spoon. Turn it over onto itself to allow every side to touch the bottom of the saucepan, allowing it to dry, however, keeping it moving all the while or it will burn. You will know the paste is dry enough when it begins to leave a thin film on the bottom of the saucepan.\nRemove the saucepan from the heat and transfer the paste to a large mixing bowl. Mix with an electric mixer on low speed for about 2 minutes to release some of the steam. This will prevent the eggs from cooking and scrambling when combined with the paste. Continue to mix and slowly add the eggs one at a time, incorporating well after each addition. After each egg is added, the paste will become loose and look separated, which is okay. Once each egg is well incorporated, the paste will become smooth and homogenous again. The number of eggs you will wind up using will vary depending on the size of the eggs and how well the pate a choux is dried. The drier it is, the more eggs you will need. After you have added 4 eggs, check the consistency by scooping a large amount of the paste onto a wooden spoon. Hold the spoon horizontally about one foot above the bowl and watch as the batter falls from the spoon back into the bowl. If it is pale yellow, smooth, moist, slightly elastic, sticky, and takes about 5 to 7 seconds to fall into the bowl, it is ready. If it appears rough, dry, and falls into the bowl in one big ball, it needs more eggs. Add another egg and check the consistency again after it is well incorporated. If necessary, add one more egg. If the pate a choux is too dry, it will not pipe well. If it is too wet, it will be loose and runny, and won't hold its shape.\nPlace the batter into a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch straight tip. Pipe the batter into 1 1/2-inch mounds on a parchment lined sheetpan about 1 1/2 inches apart as they will spread slightly when baked. Using the same plate as a guide from the puff pastry, trace a ring onto a piece of parchment paper. Flip the paper over and pipe a ring of choux batter along the line that is about 1 1/2 inches wide.\nBake the choux for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and bake until golden brown and dry on the inside, about 15 minutes more. To help the choux dry, you can open the oven door during the last 5 minutes of baking to let out the steam.\nFor the Caramel: Place the sugar, corn syrup, and water in a 1-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat and cook until light golden brown. When the desired color is reached, remove the pan from the heat and carefully pour into a medium-size glass bowl. If you leave the sugar in the pan, the sugar will continue to cook and turn dark brown, whereas a glass bowl will hold the temperature of the sugar.\nTo assemble the St. Honore, divide the chocolate pastry cream in half. Reserving a small amount of whipped cream for decoration, mix the rest with one half of the pastry cream creating a lightened version. Dab the bottom of the choux ring with the caramel and set on the puff pastry circle. Cut 4 puffs in half and using caramel, glue the puff bottoms to the top of the ring, spacing them equally. Dip the tops of the puffs in caramel and set aside. Pipe the chocolate pastry cream into a mound in the center of the ring. Using a star tip, cover the mound with lightened chocolate pastry cream in straight lines, starting at the center and moving outward. Pipe the lightened chocolate pastry cream into each puff bottom. Place the puff tops on the filled puff bottoms. Place one more caramel-dipped puff at the top of the dessert. Decorate with whipped cream by making rosettes or trails of whipped cream from top to bottom.", "ingredients": ["4 cups unbleached flour", "1 1/2 teaspoons salt", "1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled", "1/4 cup water", "1 1/4 cups butter, cold", "3 tablespoons light corn syrup", "1 tablespoon water", "2 tablespoons cornstarch", "1/2 cup sugar", "4 egg yolks", "2 cups whole milk", "1 vanilla bean", "1 tablespoon unsalted butter, optional", "2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped", "1 teaspoon sugar", "1 1/4 cups water", "1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, cubed", "1 1/4 cups bread flour", "1 teaspoon salt", "5 to 6 eggs", "2 1/2 cups sugar", "1/3 cup light corn syrup", "1/2 cup water", "Whipped cream, add at your discretion (and love of whipped cream)"], "title": "St. Honore", "picture_link": "OY0qKWNZS6ek2XgoCOyfvRs7So2mHlW"}, "29427": {"instructions": "Special equipment: 20 to 24 wooden skewers\nAdd 10 to 12 ice cubes to a medium mixing bowl and fill with cold water.

Line muffin tins with 16 \"Texas\" liners or 24 regular cupcake liners.\nSift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt, set aside.\nCombine the melted butter with the sugar in a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat on medium speed for 1 minute.

Add half of the buttermilk and mix to combine. Repeat with another third of the flour and the rest of the buttermilk, ending with the last third of flour, mixing after each addition. Mix the cake batter on medium-low speed for 1 minute.\nScoop the batter into the cupcake liners, not filling more than half way. You may end up having to fill a few more cupcake liners, but don't overfill.\nBake for about 20 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean. Let the cupcakes cool completely before decorating.\nTo make the Frosting:\nCream together the butter, shortening and sugar until perfectly smooth. Add the cream one tablespoon at a time until it is nice and creamy, but still holds its shape. Cover tightly if you don't use it immediately or it will develop a crisp crust.\nYou can use it white or tint the frosting with food coloring. I usually divide the frosting into a few bowls and color each a different color. Cover the frosting when not using.\nTo decorate your cupcakes with roses:\nUsing a disposable pastry bag, fitted with a large rose tip (Ateco #128) and an extra large rose nail (Ateco #914) you can create these large colorful roses.\nStart by lining up the narrow end of the rose tip with the seam of the pastry bag. Place a thin line of the food coloring along the seam of the bag, that leads to the narrow end of the tip. Fill the bag half way with the frosting.\nOnce your pastry bag is set up with frosting you will create a mound of frosting on the rose nail. This will be the base of your rose. If the mound is too small your rose will tip over as you are piping it. Making it nice and broad along the bottom is key.\nHold the bag at a 45degrees angle, wide end of the tip touching the mound you just created, near its top. The narrow end of the tube should be nearly straight up and pointing toward the center of the nail.\nSqueeze out a ribbon of frosting and turn the nail, holding it between your thumb and forefinger, counter clockwise; swing the rose tip up, around the top of the mound and back down to the starting point. This creates the rose bud.\nNow make the first row of 3 petals. Hold the tip so the wide end is touching the mound about half way up, starting right where the bud finished off. Tilt the narrow end of the tip slightly away from the center. Squeeze out the frosting, turning the nail counterclockwise and move the tip up (increase the pressure) and then down (decreasing the pressure) in an arch. Form all three petals in this way, starting each one where the last petal finished.\nPipe a second row of 5 petals, under the row you just finished. Tilt the tip out even more with this row so the petals appear to be opening up. Overlap the petals to hide any openings between them.\nYou can stop at this point or continue on with a third row of 7 petals.\nIt may take you a few roses to get the hang of it, but then it will go together very fast. Once you are happy with the size and shape of your rose, take a pair of kitchen shears and cut the base of the rose off of the nail. You will want to cut only part way through, so you can lift up the rose on the blades of the shears. Then place the rose on the cooled cupcake.

Make sure you chopped the chocolate as finely as possible to allow it to melt quickly and easily. Place the chopped chocolate in a medium-size mixing bowl. Make a ganache by pouring about 1/2 of the hot cream over the chocolate and letting it sit for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate. Then, slowly whisk until smooth and homogenous. Do not add all of the hot cream to the cold chocolate at once. The shock of the temperature extremes will cause the fat in the chocolate to separate. As the chocolate melts, you will see some elasticity if there is no fat separation. This means the chocolate still has an emulsion; the fat molecules are still holding together. If the ganache separates, it loses its elasticity, collapses, and becomes very liquid. I use a hand-held immersion blender to ensure a smooth ganache and to keep the emulsion of the chocolate. Add the remaining cream gradually and mix until all of the hot cream is incorporated and the ganache is smooth and homogenous.\nIf the ganache separates, it is very easy to fix. Simply add a small amount of cold cream and whisk well. This will bring the ganache back together. The ganache should be thick, shiny, and smooth. Add the desired flavoring and mix until fully incorporated. Pour the ganache onto a plastic wrap-covered baking sheet and spread evenly with a rubber spatula.

Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden.\nUse a spatula to spread some of the cooled ganache into the chocolate mold.

Add 1/2 cup flour; mix until smooth. Scrape this butter mixture onto a piece of waxed paper. Form into a 5-inch square, wrap; transfer to the refrigerator to chill. Place remaining flour in mixer bowl; add salt and 1 cup water. Mix carefully into a smooth dough, being careful not to over mix. Gather dough into a ball, and wrap in plastic. Chill a few minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a 6 by-12-inch rectangle. Place the chilled butter square in the center of the rectangle. Fold the flour dough over the butter dough, completely encasing the butter. Press the edges of the dough together, sealing as well as possible. Transfer to a sheet of waxed paper; chill until dough and butter reach the same temperature, about 1 hour. On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough into a 3/8-inch-thick rectangle. Fold into thirds, like a letter, and roll into another 3/8-inch-thick rectangle. Transfer dough to waxed paper, and chill 1 hour. (Try to use as little flour as possible for the rolling, and brush off any excess before folding dough.) Repeat rolling-and-folding process 2 more times; chill 1 hour. Roll and fold 2 more times. When you fold the dough for the sixth time, the dough should be extremely smooth and silky, with no lumps of butter visible. (If the dough becomes too elastic, set aside in a cool place 15 to 20 minutes before rolling.) Divide dough in half. Wrap each half in plastic wrap. Refrigerate one half for the gateau Saint-Honore, and freeze the other half for another use.\nMake the pate a choux: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper; set aside. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Combine butter and 1 cup water in a small saucepan, and set over high heat. Bring to a boil, and immediately add flour and salt. Beat continuously with a wooden spoon until the dough comes away from the sides of the pan. Transfer the mixture to the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Set aside 1 1/2 cups dough for assembling the cake. Place remaining mixture in a pastry bag fitted with an Ateco #9824 tip. Pipe 1-inch balls, spaced 1 1/2 inches apart, on the prepared baking sheet. Bake balls until dark golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Set 18 balls aside; freeze remaining balls in an airtight container for another use. Using a small paring knife, make a small hole in the bottom of each ball. Set aside.\nMake the creme patissiere: Combine milk, heavy cream, and vanilla bean in a medium saucepan. Set pan over medium heat, and bring the milk mixture just to a boil. Remove the pan from heat, cover, and let mixture steep 10 to 12 minutes. Remove and discard vanilla bean. In a small bowl, whisk together egg yolks and sugar until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add flour, and continue whisking egg mixture until smooth. Slowly pour the hot milk mixture into the egg mixture. Whisk this new mixture until it is completely smooth and free of lumps. Return new mixture to pan, and place over medium heat. Bring mixture to a boil, whisking constantly; cook 2 minutes more. Transfer the pastry cream to a bowl. Lay a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of the pastry cream to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate until ready to use. Place half of the pastry cream in a pastry bag fitted with an Ateco #6 round tip; reserve the remaining pastry cream for assembling the cake. Pipe pastry cream into each of the 18 reserved balls. Set the filled cream puffs aside until you are ready to dip them in the caramel.\nMake the caramel: Prepare an ice-water bath, and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper; set both aside. Combine sugar, 1/4 cup water, and corn syrup in a small saucepan. Set over high heat, and bring to a boil. Swirl the pan occasionally until the sugar has dissolved. Continue cooking until the syrup is golden amber. Remove pan from heat, and plunge bottom of pan in the ice bath to stop cooking. Dip the top of each of the 18 filled cream puffs in the molten caramel. Place the balls, top-sides down, on the prepared baking sheet; the caramel will harden and flatten, and this surface will become the top of the cake. Make the caramel fans: Place a sheet of parchment paper on a clean work surface. Using a small offset spatula, place a small amount of molten caramel on the parchment. Starting from the center, draw out the caramel in a few quick strokes, creating a fan. Repeat making more fans with the remaining caramel. Set fans aside to harden and dry.\nMake the creme chantilly: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine heavy cream, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla. Beat on high speed until the mixture forms stiff peaks, 2 to 3 minutes. Chill until ready to use. Assemble the cake: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper, and set aside. Roll the pate feuilletee dough out to an 1/8-inch thickness. Using a plate or a bowl as a guide, cut out 2 (8-inch) circles from the dough. Prick the circles all over with a fork or a pastry docker to prevent the dough from rising. Place the circles on the prepared baking sheets. Brush the outer edge of the circles with the beaten egg. Place the reserved pate a choux dough in a pastry bag fitted with an Ateco #9824 tip. Pipe dough around the rim of each circle. With remaining dough, pipe a spiral in the center of each circle, starting in the middle. Bake until the pastry is crisp and deep golden brown, 50 to 55 minutes. Transfer baking sheets to a wire rack to cool. Dip uncoated sides of cream puffs, 1 by 1, in the caramel. Arrange on the pastries, 9 per circle, leaving space in between; the caramel will hold the cream puffs to the pastry. Combine the remaining pastry cream and 1/4 of the creme chantilly in a bowl. Place the mixed cream in a pastry bag fitted with an Ateco #9824 tip. Fill the center of each circle with cream mixture. Place the remaining creme chantilly in a pastry bag fitted with an Ateco #9824 tip. Pipe large rosettes between the caramel-covered cream puffs.

Make a ganache by pouring about half of the hot cream over the chocolate and letting it sit for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate. Then, slowly whisk until smooth and homogenous. Do not add all of the hot cream to the cold chocolate at once. The shock of the temperature extremes will cause the fat in the chocolate to separate. As the chocolate melts, you will see some elasticity if there is no fat separation. This means the chocolate still has an emulsion; the fat molecules are still holding together. If the ganache separates, it loses its elasticity, collapses, and becomes very liquid. I use a hand-held immersion blender to ensure a smooth ganache and to keep the emulsion of the chocolate.
