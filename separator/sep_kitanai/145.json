Using clean hands, add the butter and toss until just coated. Work the butter into the flour until the mixture is in clumps the size of quarters, about 2 minutes. The butter clumps should go from small chunks to larger chunks. Add the shortening, toss until just coated in flour, then rub it into the flour mixture until the mixture forms pea-size pieces (some big chunks should remain) and comes together in fist-sized clumps when squeezed, about 1 minute. Drizzle in half the ice water and rake through the mixture with your fingers until just moistened. Drizzle in the remaining water 1 tablespoon at a time and comb through the mixture with our fingers to moisten. The mixture will eventually come together; the dough is moist enough when it is moistened through but is not wet when pressed. (Do not overwork the dough or it will become tough.)\nWhile rotating the bowl with one hand, use the palm of your other hand to push the dough along the side of the bowl to gather it into a ball.
