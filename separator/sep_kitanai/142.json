Bake until a bit overcooked, about 45 minutes. Let sit until cool enough to handle, cut in half, and scoop out the flesh. Reserve the potato skins, if desired, for another use.\nPass the potatoes through a potato ricer or grate them on the large holes of a box grater. You should have about 2 cups. Make a mound of potatoes on the counter with a well in the middle, add 3 of the egg yolks, the cheese, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Mix in the potatoes and mix well with hands. Sprinkle 1/2 cup of the flour over the potatoes and, using your knuckles, press it into the potatoes. Fold the mass over on itself and press down again. Sprinkle on more flour, little by little, folding and pressing the dough until it just holds together, (try not to knead it.) Work any dough clinging to your fingers back into the dough. If the mixture is too dry, add another egg yolk or a little water. The dough should give under slight pressure. It will feel firm but yielding. To test if the dough is the correct consistency, take a piece and roll it with your hands on a well-floured board into a rope 1/2-inch in diameter. If the dough holds together, it is ready. If not, add more flour, fold and press the dough several more times, and test again.\nKeeping your work surface and the dough lightly floured, cut the dough into 4 pieces. Roll each piece into a rope about 1/2-inch in diameter. Cut into 1/2-inch-long pieces. Lightly flour the gnocchi as you cut them. You can cook these as is or form them into the classic gnocchi shape with a gnocchi board, ridged butter paddle, or the tines of a large fork turned upside down. Rest the bottom edge of the gnocchi board on the work surface, then tilt it at about a 45 degree angle. Take each piece and squish it lightly with your thumb against the board while simultaneously pushing it away from you. It will roll away and around your thumb, taking on a cupped shape -- with ridges on the outer curve from the board and a smooth surface on the inner curve where your thumb was. (Shaping them takes some time and dexterity. You might make a batch just for practice.) The indentation holds the sauce and helps gnocchi cook faster.\nAs you shape the gnocchi, dust them lightly with flour and scatter them on baking sheets lined with parchment paper or waxed paper.

Butter four 9-inch round cake pans, dusting them in flour to ensure the batter does not stick to the pan.\nSift together the flour, baking powder and salt into a medium bowl and set aside. In another medium bowl, whisk together the buttermilk and egg whites until incorporated. Set aside.\nIn a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar on medium speed until very light, about 3 minutes. Beat in the almond and vanilla extracts. Continue to beat on medium speed and add 1/3 of the sifted flour mixture until incorporated. Add 1/2 of the buttermilk mixture, again beating until incorporated. Again, add 1/3 of the sifted flour and, once incorporated, add the rest of the buttermilk mixture until homogeneous. Finally, add in the remaining flour mixture and continue beating the batter on medium speed for 1 to 2 minutes to insure the ingredients are well mixed.\nDivide the batter evenly among the four pans and smooth the tops with a spatula. Bake until a toothpick comes out clean and the cakes are springy to the touch, 25 to 30 minutes.\nPlace the cakes on a wire rack and let cool for 10 minutes. Run a knife between the rim of the pan and the cake to insure the cake will cleanly detach. Remove the cakes from the pans and invert on the rack until completely cool.\nTo assemble the cake:\nLevel each layer of almond cake with a cake leveler or serrated knife. Place a spoonful of buttercream on your serving plate, followed by your first layer of cake, cut-side up. Place the remaining buttercream in a pastry bag with a frosting tip.\nEvenly cover your first layer with about 1/3 cup of creme frangipane. Next create a moat of buttercream around the layer of cake with the piping bag in preparation for the lingonberry jam. Evenly spread 1/3 cup lingonberry jam within the moat. Finish the layer by piping icing over the layer, about a 1/4 inch thick.\nAdd the next layer of cake and repeat the previous steps. Repeat with the third layer of cake. Complete the cake with the 4th layer of cake, cut-side down. Frost the cake with the remaining buttercream and top with a few lingonberries from the jam.\nBe sure all tools are thoroughly degreased before beginning. (I usually use lemon juice or vinegar to remove all traces of grease.)\nIn a small bowl, combine 3 tablespoons of water with the almond and vanilla extracts and set aside.

Bring the sugar and water to a boil until it reaches 238 degrees F. DO NOT STIR. Stirring will cause the sugar crystals to adhere to the edge of the saucepan, causing the syrup to become grainy. Be sure not to overcook the sugar, as it will crystalize and form brittle chunks in your frosting. Once the syrup is heated to 238 degrees F, immediately remove from the heat. Slowly and steadily stream the syrup into the eggs while mixing on low, avoiding the edge of the bowl as well as the whisk. Once the eggs and syrup are incorporated, add in the extract mixture and beat on medium speed until completely cool, 3 to 5 minutes.\nBeat in the butter, one piece at a time until silky smooth. (If your buttercream curdles, do not despair! Simply heat the bowl over the stove until slightly warmed, 10 to 20 seconds, until the buttercream becomes slightly melted near the edge of the bowl. Return the bowl to the mixer and beat on medium-high speed until smooth.)\nIn a food processor, pulse the almond paste until crumbly.
