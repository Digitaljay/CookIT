Sterilizing jars is the first step of preserving foods.\nTips:\nJars should be made from glass and free of any chips or cracks. Preserving or canning jars are topped with a glass, plastic, or metal lid, which has a rubber seal. Two piece lids are best for canning, as they vacuum seal when processed.\nTo sterilize jars, before filling with jams, pickles, or preserves, wash jars and lids with hot, soapy water. Rinse well and arrange jars and lids open sides up, without touching, on a tray. Boil the jars and lids in a large saucepan, covered with water, for 15 minutes.\nUse tongs when handling the hot sterilized jars, to move them from boiling water. Be sure the tongs are sterilized too, by dipping the ends in boiling water for a few minutes.\nAs a rule, hot preserves go into hot jars and cold preserves go into cold jars. All items used in the process of making jams, jellies, and preserves must be clean. This includes any towels used, and especially your hands.\nAfter the jars are sterilized, you can preserve the food.

Shake the pan slightly to distribute the sugar in an even layer on the bottom of the pan. Lower the heat and keep your eye on the sugar as it melts and begins to turn brown. Lift the pan and swirl the sugar around from time to time as it melts. Do not stir with any utensils. Any impurities on the utensil could also disturb the sugar as it melts.*\nPrepare a baking sheet lined a silicon mat or parchment paper. Spray a layer of nonstick spray on the parchment, if using. Set aside. When the hazelnuts cool slightly and the caramel is a light brown, use a clean spoon to stir the hazelnuts into the caramel. Spray the spoon with nonstick spray so that the sugar doesn't stick to the end of the spoon as you work. Stir the nuts, coating them with the sugar. Use the spoon to scoop out the hazelnuts and spread them on to the lined baking sheet. Spread them as best you can without creating big clumps. Sprinkle with a touch of salt.

Use your hands to finish combining the wet and dry ingredients. Break apart and roughly chop the hazelnuts and gently work half of them into the dough. Reserve remaining half for snacking.\nPrepare a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and lightly spray with cooking spray.\nDivide the dough into 2 equal parts. Using your hands, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured flat surface. Form each half of the dough into a loaf-like shape about 2 inches wide and about 12 inches long. They should look like 2 loaves of bread. Carefully arrange the 2 loaves, side by side, on the baking sheet. For optimum baking, leave as much space as possible between the loaves.\nPut the baking sheet in the center of the oven and bake, undisturbed, for 25 to 30 minutes. The dough should be light brown and may rise a little as it cooks. Remove from the oven and put onto a flat surface to cool. Turn the oven off.\nOnce cooled, using a serrated knife, gently saw the loaf into 1/2-inch thick slices, cut on an angle. Arrange the slices on the baking sheet, cut sides up, in a single layer. There should be a little space between each slice. It will almost feel like the loaves are 2 puzzles that you take apart by cutting and then put back together on the baking sheet.\nReturn the baking sheet to the oven.

Take care to scrape the sides of the pot so the curd doesnt form a crust on the edges or scorch as it cooks. After a few minutes, start gradually whisking in the slices of butter. When all of the butter is integrated, remove the pot from the heat. Transfer the curd to another bowl to cool, then cover it tightly with a layer of plastic wrap.

Bring to a simmer and stir until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat and add the ice cubes to bring down the temperature. Once cooled and the ice cubes have dissolved, add to a resealable plastic container (or a plastic bag) and add the pork chops. Place in the fridge for 1 hour.\nTie each pork chop around the perimeter with a piece of kitchen twine. This will help the chop retain a nice, round shape while cooking.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F.\nRemove the chops from the brine and pat dry with some paper towels (removing the excess moisture on the surface allows the pork chop to sear and caramelize). Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Set a large cast-iron skillet over high heat. Coat the pan with oil and when the oil starts to smoke, add the pork chops to the pan. Cook over high heat until well browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Turn the chops over and reduce the heat slightly to allow the chops to cook through. Cook on the second side until golden brown, about 8 minutes. When done, remove the pork chops from the skillet and place onto a sheet tray. Divide the slices of the Brie between the chops and layer evenly on each so they are covered well. Place the sheet tray into the oven and cook until the Brie is just melted and the pork has cooked to 140 to 145 degrees F. Remove from the oven and transfer the chops to a plate to rest.\nFor the pan sauce: Meanwhile, place the skillet back over medium-high heat. Add a drizzle of olive oil and then add the apples and onions. Saute for 4 to 5 minutes, and then add the Calvados. Allow the alcohol to cook off (you can flambe at this stage if desired by igniting the Calvados in the pan). Once the Calvados has reduced, add the stock and simmer. Season with some salt and pepper. Allow to reduce for 2 to 3 minutes, and then remove from the heat and swirl in the cold butter cubes. This will thicken the sauce and give it a nice sheen.

Whisk them together on low speed to aerate the flour.\nHeat the milk: Set a small pot on low heat. Pour in the milk and heat until just warm (75 degrees F if you are using a thermometer). Turn off the heat.\nMake the doughnuts: With the stand mixer running at low speed, add the sugar, salt and warm milk to the flour mixture.\nWith the mixer still running at low speed, add 1 egg at a time until all the eggs are fully incorporated into the batter. Dribble in the vanilla extract. Scrape the batter down the sides of the bowl fully.

With the mixer running at low speed, add the butter, one cube at a time, until fully incorporated into the batter.\nAt this point, the dough should gather around the paddle of the stand mixer and gently slump off when you turn the mixer off. If it feels too wet, add a bit more flour. Turn the dough onto a lightly-floured surface. Wet your hands lightly.\nGently pat the dough, which will be sticky. Don't worry. That's why you wet your hands. Gently shape the dough, stretching and pulling as you can, into a large ball. Make a seam with the edges of the dough together. Put the dough, seam-side down, into a greased bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit in a warm place in the kitchen for 1 hour.\nRoll out the dough: With wet hands, gather the dough and plop it onto a lightly-floured piece of parchment paper. Flour a rolling pin and roll out the dough just shy of the edges of the parchment paper. (Remember to go slowly. This will not feel like gluten dough.) The dough should be about 1-inch thick. Put the parchment paper onto a baking sheet and place it in the freezer for 10 minutes.\nCut out the doughnuts: Using a 3-inch doughnut cutter (or biscuit cutter or an empty tin can, if that's all you have), cut out 8 rounds from the dough. Cut holes in the rounds with a much smaller cutter. (You could also use your finger.) Set them aside on a piece of parchment paper.\nYou can roll out the remaining dough and cut out more doughnuts, if you want. They won't be quite as light as the first batch, but they are still doughnuts!\nLet the doughnuts rest while you prepare the oil.\nHeat the oil: Set a Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
