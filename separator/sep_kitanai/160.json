Brush dough lightly with cold water. Place a sheet of vanilla dough on the workspace, and remove top sheet of paper. Using the bottom piece of the paper to lift the dough, place the vanilla dough on top of the chocolate dough. Take care to line up the edges of the 2 doughs and trim as needed. Lightly press to smooth and seal the doughs together. Remove the top piece of paper. Brush the surface of the dough lightly with cold water.

Repeat with remaining 2 sheets of dough.\nEvenly position racks in the oven, and preheat to 325 degrees F.\nSlice the dough crosswise into 1/4-inch thick cookies. Lay about 1/2-inch apart on parchment-lined baking sheets.

Put 1 of the chocolate doughs on the work space and remove the top sheet of parchment. Brush lightly with a little cold water. Place 1 of vanilla doughs on the work space. Remove top sheet of paper, and use the bottom piece of the paper to lift the dough onto the chocolate dough. Take care to lining up the edges of the dough. Lightly press to smooth and seal the doughs together. Remove the top parchment.\nTrim the edges on the layered doughs with a pizza cutter using a ruler or other straight edge as a guide. Working with the short edge facing you, cut the layered dough in half vertically. Set 1 piece on top of the other and then turn the dough, to have the long side facing you. Cut the dough in half again and set 1 piece on top of the other. Wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 2 hours before slicing.\nTrim any uneven edges with a sharp knife.

Place 1/4 cup oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion, and saute until it is limp, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, bay leaf and a pinch of chili flakes. Reduce heat to low and cook 7 minutes longer. Add wine, and bring to a simmer. Add clams, cover pot, and cook till they start to open, about 10 minutes. As they open, use tongs to transfer them to a large bowl. When all clams are cooked and cooled, pluck out meat, and discard shells.

Strain through a fine-mesh sieve, and set aside.\nTake a pizza peel and dust the surface with flour. Form the dough into a 12-inch round. Working quickly, paint the entire surface of the pizza with one-quarter of the clam glaze. Scatter a dozen or so clams over the pizza and sprinkle with chili flakes. Drizzle with oil. Place peel into brick oven. Slide off the peel. Watch the pizza and continue to rotate it in the oven until all sides of the crust bubble up, allowing for some black bubbles, but not too many. (Approximately 2 minutes.) Take the pizza out of the oven and sprinkle with chili flakes and scatter with parsley.

You can let it sit out longer as long as it doesn't get too soft and floppy, which will make it difficult to shape. Soft dough is also more likely to stick to the cookie sheet or pizza peel, making it harder to slide onto the stone.
