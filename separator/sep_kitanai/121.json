As soon as it subsides and begins to have a nutty aroma, pull the saucepan immediately off the heat. The butter will burn quickly so be careful. Set aside to cool. Begin making the sticky dough in a large mixing bowl by sprinkling the yeast over the warm water. Let the yeast sit until slightly foamy and creamy, 5 to 6 minutes. Heat the milk and sugar in a small saucepan over low heat just until the sugar dissolves. Add the browned butter and set aside to cool. Add the cooled milk mixture to the yeast and whisk to combine. Add 15 ounces of the pumpkin puree and the salt and mix with a spatula. The dough will become sticky. Start adding the flour, one cup at a time until you have added all the flour. Feel the dough and if it's really soft, add an additional 1/4 cup flour. Mix the dough with your hands. While still in the bowl, keep folding the dough onto itself, 2 to 3 minutes. Place the pumpkin dough in a larger lightly-oiled bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic and allow the dough to rise until it's doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours depending on the temperature in your kitchen. I place my dough in the laundry room, it's the warmest place in my house. When the dough has doubled in size, punch down the dough and either cover and chill the dough overnight or use it right away. In a medium bowl, combine the brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, salt and cloves. Toss to mix and set aside. Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces. Remove one piece at a time while keeping the other half covered with plastic wrap. Lightly flour a work surface. Shape the dough into a rectangle. Since the dough is super soft, you may need additional flour. Keep in mind too much flour will make the dough heavy and dry. Roll each piece of dough into a 12- by 18-inch rectangle. Brush off any excess flour. Spread half the softened butter on each rectangle of dough, leaving a 1-inch border across the top length of the dough, followed by the remaining 7 ounces pumpkin puree - it will be messy, that's ok - and then half the brown sugar mixture. Starting with the wider edge, start rolling the dough from the bottom upwards. Roll this as tightly as you can. When you come up to the 1-inch border, slightly pinch it together. Once completed, set the first log on a baking pan and chill while rolling the remaining dough. Repeat the steps with the remaining dough, making sure to chill each log in between. These logs can be chilled overnight or for 2 hours if you want to bake them the same day. These are much easier to cut when cold. For the caramel: While the dough is chilling, place a small pan over low heat and melt the butter. Add the brown sugar, corn syrup and salt. Increase the heat to medium and whisk until the sugar and syrup are dissolved, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat, whisk in the bourbon. The caramel should look shiny. If not, put back on the heat for 1 minute. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray the muffin pans. Pour about 1 1/2 tablespoon of the warm caramel into each muffin mold. Drop 2 to 3 toasted pecan halves into the caramel. Set aside and allow the caramel to cool to room temperature. Set aside the extra caramel sauce and pecans. Cut each log of buns into eight 1 1/2-inch slices. Round up the buns and fit them into pans, cover with a damp cloth and place in a warm spot until they double in size, about 30 minutes. Bake the buns, 22 to 25 minutes. It's a bit hard to test for doneness due to the sticky (and yummy) caramel. I tend to slightly under-bake them by 1 to 2 minutes rather than over-bake. Carefully remove the buns from the oven and allow them to cool in the pan, 5 to 10 minutes. Place a baking pan on top of the muffin pan and quickly invert. The buns should slowly unmold. Reheat 1 to 2 minutes if they are sticking.\nAuthor: Hedy Goldsmith Date: August 2012\nBefore serving, toss the remaining pecans with the caramel sauce and add spoonfuls over the tops. These are best eaten warm, not hot, out of the oven. Cook's Note: Use extra-large muffin pans to bake perfectly shaped sticky buns.

Immediately remove from the pan onto a dish; wipe the pan clean with a dry towel.\nPlace the water, granulated sugar and corn syrup in the pan, stir to combine, and return to the stove. Increase the heat to medium-high. Cook without stirring until the sugar begins to turn a golden caramel.\nImmediately turn the heat to low and add the hazelnuts, banana chips and salt, and stir to coat.\nSpread the praline on the parchment-lined baking sheet to cool. When cool, break the praline into pieces with your hands, or pulse into small pieces in a food processor.\nBanana Cake:\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line cupcake pans with 24 baking cups.\nIn a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, combine the bananas, granulated sugar and brown sugar and mix on medium-low until well-combined, about 1 minute.\nWith the mixer running, slowly pour in the oil and vanilla. Continue mixing until combined. Stop the mixer, remove the bowl and paddle, and use the paddle to scrape the inside of the bowl, making sure everything is fully incorporated. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg and add to the batter. Reattach the bowl and paddle to the mixer and mix on medium until just combined, then add the eggs and continue mixing until the batter is smooth, about 10 to 20 seconds. Remove the bowl and paddle from the mixer and, once again, use the paddle to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl, ensuring that everything is well-mixed.\nScoop the batter into the prepared baking cups, filling them 2/3 of the way.\nBake in the middle of the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. The cupcakes are done once the centers spring back when you touch them.\nRemove the cupcakes from the oven and let cool completely while you make the buttercream.\nNutella Buttercream:\nFor French Buttercream (recommended): Prepare the recipe as directed below. Once the butter is added, add the Nutella and cocoa powder and mix on high to combine.\nAssembly:\nFill a pastry bag fitted with a fluted tip with the Nutella buttercream and pipe onto each banana cupcake.\nPlace pieces of banana-hazelnut praline on the top of each cupcake.\nShortcut:\nSkip the praline. If you still want a crunchy top, you can sprinkle some crushed banana chips, roasted hazelnuts or a mixture of the two on top.\nThis is it: the star of the show, the main event, the most-important part of our cupcakes - buttercream! As this is French buttercream, this is tres, tres serious. You will pay attention, follow along and execute these directions! C'est serieux! Now let's do this!\nIn a heavy nonreactive saucepan, add water, sugar, corn syrup and cream of tartar. The last two help keep the sugar from crystallizing. (Candy thermometer is nonnegotiable!)\nPut the pan on high heat. It's going to be there for a while. Be patient and keep your eye on it. Don't go walking away and watch TV or something.\nPut yolks and egg in a stand mixer with the whisk attachment and turn to high. Just let it go! Eggs will triple in volume and go to the \"ribbon stage.\" You can't overwhip!\nWait on the sugar - you're looking for 235 degrees F, aka \"soft-ball stage.\" When it happens, be ready to move quickly. Turn off the mixer and add xanthan gum, then turn back on to medium speed. Remove the thermometer from hot sugar. Lift pan with two hands.\nRest the lip of the saucepan on the edge of the mixer bowl. Slowly tilt and pour sugar in a sloooow steady stream down the side of the bowl. Don't go too fast! If you do there will be chunks of scrambled eggs in your buttercream.\nOnce sugar is all in, turn the mixer to high. Beat til cool. Gauge this by putting the inside of your wrist on the outside of the bowl. It's more accurate than your hands.\nSwitch out the whisk for the paddle. Next we're adding the butter. It's too heavy for the whisk and you'll end up breaking your stand mixer if you stay with the whisk.\nStart cutting the butter into thin pieces - you could shave it with a cheese slicer if you'd like. Add butter piece by piece - pain in the derriere, yes, but we're making an emulsion.\nSee, if you dump all the butter in at once, the butter and eggs will never combine properly and you'll have a \"broken\" buttercream. You'll be able to identify this easily - it'll be a chunky, watery, hot mess.\nIf your buttercream does break, you can fix it! Turn to medium-high, then add a little more butter, piece by piece, til fixed. Or try adding a little guar gum! This is very strong, so only add a pinch and beat for a minute, then check.\nOnce your butter is added, turn the mixer to medium-high to add some air - 10 or 20 seconds at most. Quelle magnifique! It should be fluffy and make you want to eat it with your fingers.\nOnce you have your base, there are so many ways to flavor it! Coffee powder! Vanilla beans! Dutch cocoa! Peanut butter! Caramel! Ham! (OK; maybe not ham. Party pooper.)\nCongratulations! You did it!
