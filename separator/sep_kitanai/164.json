Increase the speed to medium and knead until the dough is smooth and pulls away from the side of the bowl, approximately 4 to 5 minutes. Cook's Note: Kneading the dough can also be done by hand.\nRemove the dough from the bowl, clean the bowl and then oil it well with vegetable oil. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap and sit in a warm place for approximately 1 hour or until the dough has doubled in size. Knock the air out for 30 seconds by punching it down. You can now shape the dough into a ball, then place it onto a flour-dusted baking tray lined with parchment paper.

If it sounds hollow it's done, if it doesn't then pop it back in for a little longer. Once cooked, place the bread on a rack and allow it to cool for about 1 1/2 hours.\nFor the stuffing:\nCube up the cooled cornbread and set aside.\nIn a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the Morteau sausage and cook for about 5 minutes, until golden brown. Add the onions, celery, pepper, and garlic and continue cooking until translucent, about 5 minutes. Deglaze with the veal stock. Add in the cornbread. Transfer to a large bowl. Add the oysters and their liquid, parsley, paprika, and melted butter. Season the stuffing with salt, and pepper, to taste. Reserve the stuffing in the refrigerator until ready to use.\nTo assemble the turducken:\nSpread the deboned turkey, skin-side down on a flat surface, exposing as much meat as possible. Sprinkle the meat generously and evenly with a total of about 3 tablespoons of the smoked paprika, patting the seasoning in with your hands. Cook's Note: Be sure to turn the leg, thigh and wing meat to the outside so you can season it too. Season the turkey with salt and pepper.\nThen stuff some of the stuffing in the leg, thigh and wing cavities until full but not tightly packed. Cook's Note: If too tightly packed, it may cause the leg and wing to burst open during cooking). Spread an even layer of the stuffing over the remaining exposed meat, about 1/2 to 3/4-inches thick. You should use a total of about 4 cups of stuffing.\nFor the duck: Remove some of the fat and keep aside. Place the duck, skin-side down, on top of the stuffing, arranging the duck evenly over the stuffing. Season the exposed duck meat generously and evenly with smoked paprika, using about 1 tablespoon, and pressing it in with your hands. Season the duck with salt and pepper. Then spread about 1 cup of the stuffing evenly over the exposed duck meat, making the layer slightly less thick, about 1/2-inch thick. Repeat with the chicken and the remaining stuffing. Place an Italian truffle in the center, optional.\nEnlist someone's help to close turducken. Fold the sides of the turkey together to close the bird. Have your helper hold the turkey closed while you sew up all the openings, making the stitches about 1-inch apart. When you finish sewing up the turducken on the first side, turn it over in the pan to sew closed any openings on the other side. Then tie the legs together, just above the tip bones. Leave the turducken to cook, breast-side up, in the pan, tucking in the turkey wings.\nServing suggestion: Serve with Root Vegetable Mash.\nWith the assistance of your helper, carefully lift the turducken into an ungreased 15 by 11-inch baking pan that is at least 2 1/2-inches deep. Cook's Note: This pan size is ideal because the turducken fits snugly in the pan and stays in the proper shape while cooking).\nPlace the turducken pan in a slightly larger pan with sides at least 2 1/2-inches deep, so that the larger pan will catch the overflow of drippings during cooking. Season the exposed side of the turducken with the remaining smoked paprika, patting it in with your hands. Brush with melted butter.\nBake the turducken at 325 degrees F, about 4 hours, until done, or until a meat thermometer inserted through to the center reads 165 degrees F. When done, remove the turducken from the oven and let rest for about 15 minutes\nFor the gravy:\nPlace the turducken drippings in a pot over medium-high heat. Add the stock, fresh thyme, and beurre manie. Season the gravy with salt, and pepper, to taste. Let the gravy come to a boil. Turn down heat to medium-low and let the gravy simmer for 10 minutes.\nCook's Note: Remember there are no bones to support the birds' structure.\nWith strong spatulas inserted underneath the bird, carefully transfer the turducken to a serving platter and present it to your guests before carving. Be sure to make your slices crosswise so that each slice contains the stuffing and all 3 meats.

Slice them or serve whole: sauteed peaches and sweetened ricotta; peanut butter and strawberries; sliced apples and caramel sauce; roasted pineapple, bananas, and honey; chocolate chunks, marshmallows, and graham cracker crumbs; sliced ripe banana, brown sugar, and Nutella.\nCamping sandwiches can be prepared ahead of time and made in either square or circular presses-both work fine. Depending on your make and model, adjust the filling amounts so the sandwiches are full but not too full (or they'll ooze while being toasted). The fillings can vary, and it's a good way to utilize leftover chili, mac-n- cheese, and other ingredients when camping.\nFor circular sandwiches, punch out the bread into 4-inch circles or the size of your sandwich press.\nPrepare a campfire with wood and wait until the flames die down and the coals glow red with white ash. Place a grilling rack so that it sits just above the coals. Place the presses on the grill so they heat up.\nAssemble each sandwich with the desired fillings, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges. Remove the presses from the hot grill, open, and spray with nonstick cooking spray. Place a sandwich in each press (it will sizzle-this preheating helps it form a nice crispy crust) and close tightly. Place on the grill and cook for 1 or 2 minutes per side. You can check the sandwich as it cooks by opening the press and checking the color-it should be golden brown and crispy on both sides when done. (Depending on how hot your coals are, you can also place the press directly on coals to make it cook faster-just keep an eye on it!)

Place the kernels into a bowl and using the knife, scrape up and down the shaft of the cob (over the bowl of corn) extracting the natural \"corn cream\". If using canned or frozen corn, simply begin with step #2.\nTo saute the vegetables: Melt the butter (or heat the oil) in a 2 1/2 quart heavy bottomed sauce pot (one that comes with a tight fitting lid).

Serve hot.\nTime Management Tips:\n1) For extra ease of preparation when assembling, all listed fresh vegetables can be chopped as much as one day ahead and kept refrigerated in separate (well covered) bowls.\n2) The stock can be made months ahead and kept frozen in securely covered, heavy freezer containers.\n\"Variation\" Tips:\n1) Changing the type of stock can give your rice dish a totally different taste and (at times) color. Choose your stock according to your menu and don't be afraid to mix different types of stock,vegetables (and herbs) to create an even more complex flavor. Also, always thaw more stock than you'll need so you can boil it down until the volume is reduced (which will concentrate the flavor).\nSome winning combinations of stock: Beef and chicken, chicken and shrimp, veal and beef, veal and chicken or chicken and fish.\nTips From a Teacher:\nThe most renown type of aromatic rice is Basmati rice which (once grown only in Pakistan and India), is now also grown here in the United States. This type of rice is special (although pricey) not only for it's nutty, butterlike and seductive flavor, but during cooking, the grains swell much more in length than in width, making the feel of the cooked rice more distinctive in the mouth. Basmati rice is also lower in starch which encourages the grains to remain separate.\nJasmine rice, another long grain white rice once grown exclusively in Thailand, is now also grown here and the flavor is similar to Basmati although the texture is somewhat softer when cooked. The other readilyavailable types of aromatic rice are grown here and come in both white, tan and brown varieties. All of the new domestic breeds of rice are an attempt to duplicate the flavor and aroma of Basmati, at a more affordable price. They can be identified as Texmati, Wehani and Popcorn rice (also called Wild Pecan rice). These are all delicious and lend their own unique characteristics to the finished dish.", "ingredients": ["2 large ears fresh corn shucked and all silk removed (1 large (12 to 16 ounces) drained can or 1 (10 ounce) box frozen corn may be substituted.

Pour 1 cup warm water (about 110 degrees) into a small bowl. Add the sugar, and sprinkle in the yeast. Using a fork, stir the mixture until the yeast is dissolved and water has turned a tan color. Let yeast stand until creamy and foamy, about 5 minutes. In a food processor, use blade to combine the 2 3/4 cups flour and salt, and pulse 3 to 4 times. Add yeast mixture and 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil. Pulse until the dough comes together, adding more flour as needed until dough is smooth, not tacky, when squeezed. Transfer to clean surface; knead 4 or 5 turns into a ball. Brush the inside of a medium bowl with olive oil, and place the dough in the bowl, smooth-side up. Cover tightly with plastic wrap, and place in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 40 minutes. Remove plastic wrap, and place your fist in the center of the dough to punch it down. Fold the dough back onto itself 4 or 5 times. Turn dough over, folded-side down, cover with plastic wrap, and return to the warm spot to rise again until the dough has doubled in size, about 30 minutes. Punch down the dough, and transfer to a clean surface. Using a bench scraper or a sharp knife, divide the dough in half, and knead each half 4 or 5 turns into a ball. Place 1 of the dough balls back in the oiled bowl, and cover with plastic wrap. Lightly flour a clean surface, place the remaining dough ball on top, pat into a flattened circle, cover lightly with plastic wrap, and let rest 5 minutes. Using your fingers, begin to flatten and push the dough evenly out from the center until it measures about 7 to 8 inches in diameter. Do not press the dough all the way to the edges. Leave a slightly raised border, about a 1/2-inch wide, around entire circumference of pizza dough. Sprinkle cornmeal all over the surface of a pizza peel, and set aside. Lift the dough off the surface, and center it on top of your fists. Hold your fists about 1 to 2 inches apart. Begin to rotate and stretch the dough, opening your fists until they are 6 to 8 inches apart and the dough is several inches larger. Then place your fists under the inside of the outer edge, and continue to stretch the dough a little at a time until it reaches about 12 inches in diameter. The dough will drape down over your forearms. At this stage, it is important to keep your fists along the inside of the outer edge and watch that the dough does not get too thin or tear in the center. At the same time, make sure to maintain the slightly raised border on the edges. The dough is surprisingly resilient and will not tear if this step is done carefully and slowly. Arrange the pizza dough into a circle on top of the cornmeal-dusted peel. Leaving the raised edge uncovered, pour 9 tablespoons of the pizza sauce onto the dough. Using the back of a tablespoon, evenly spread the sauce leaving a 1/2-inch border of dough uncovered. Arrange half of the mozzarella slices on top of the sauce. Lift the pizza peel and, using a slight jerking motion, slide the pizza about 1-inch back and forth on the peel to loosen it. Slightly tilt the peel, and place the front tip of peel on the back side of the stone. Slide the pizza off the peel, centering it on the stone. Bake until the crust is golden brown and crisp on the edges and the bottom, 10 to 12 minutes, turning the pizza halfway through baking. Using tongs, lift the edge of the pizza, and slide the peel all the way under to remove it from the oven. Using a pizza wheel, slice the pizza into 8 pieces, and serve immediately.

If necessary, finish folding in the sifted ingredients by hand, using a rubber spatula. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and place on a rack in the center of the oven. Bake the cake until lightly browned on top, about 70 minutes. The cake is done when a knife blade inserted into the center comes out clean and when the top of the cake springs back lightly when touched. Remove the cake from the oven and allow to cool completely. Once cooled, remove the cake from the pan and peel parchment paper from bottom of the cake. Wrap the cake tightly in plastic wrap until ready to use. The Ricotta Pound Cake can be stored for up to 1 day at room temperature or in the freezer for up to 1 week. For the blood orange simple syrup: Combine the sugar with 1/3 cup water in a small, heavy saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat, pour into a clean bowl, and allow to cool. Once fully cooled, stir in the blood orange concentrate until combined. The Blood Orange Simple Syrup will keep for up to 7 days in an airtight container in the refrigerator. For the blood orange curd: Soften the gelatin sheet in 2 cups cool water for 3 minutes. Combine the whole eggs, egg yolks, sugar and both juices into a heatproof, nonreactive mixing bowl set over a pan of simmering water (do not allow the bowl to touch the water) and whisk together until the sugar begins to dissolve. Cook, whisking continuously, until the mixture begins to thicken into a custard, 5 to 7 minutes. If using a candy thermometer, cook to 170 to 180 degrees F. Whisk the butter. The curd should be smooth and homogenous. Squeeze out the excess water from the gelatin and whisk the gelatin into the hot mixture until fully dissolved and combined. Remove the bowl from over the water and strain the curd through a medium-mesh sieve into a clean, nonreactive mixing bowl. Cover with plastic wrap pressed directly onto the surface of the curd and allow to cool in the refrigerator. The Blood Orange Curd can be stored for up to 3 days in an airtight container in the refrigerator. For the cranberry orange preserves: In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment, pulse together the cranberries and orange juice. The cranberries should still be in chunky pieces. Combine the cranberry mixture with the corn syrup and sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Stirring every 5 minutes, cook the mixture until it boils and thickens, 15 to 20 minutes. If using a candy thermometer, cook to approx. 210 degrees F. Transfer to a clean bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and cool in the refrigerator. The Cranberry Orange Preserves can be made up to 3 days in advance and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator.\nFor the blood orange whipped cream: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip together the cream and sugar until stiff peaks form, about 3 minutes. Remove the bowl from the mixer. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the Blood Orange Curd until combined, being careful not to over mix, which could make the stiffened whipped cream weak.

Using a pastry brush, moisten the cake layer with one-third of the Blood Orange Simple Syrup. Measure out 1 1/2 cups of Blood Orange Whipped Cream and set aside to be used to frost the top of the cake. Using an offset spatula, spread half of the remaining Blood Orange Whipped Cream onto the syrup-soaked cake layer, allowing the whipped cream to fill up the space between the cake and the cake pan. Use a rubber spatula to gently but firmly press the whipped cream down in between the side of the cake pan and the cake layer, thus essentially forming the side of the cake. Spoon half of the raspberry-cranberry preserves mixture onto the Blood Orange Whipped Cream, gently pressing the berries onto the cream. Top with a second layer of pound cake and repeat with another one-third of the simple syrup, the other half of the remaining Blood Orange Whipped Cream, and remaining raspberry-cranberry preserves mixture. Top with the final layer of cake and moisten with the remaining Blood Orange Simple Syrup.

Retie the casing on the stuffing tube and continue making the remaining sausage. Pinch and then twist the long pieces of sausage about every 8 inches to form links. Place the linked sausages on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and refrigerate overnight to dry.\nGrill the sausage.\nPreheat one side of a grill to medium-high and the other to low. Lightly brush the grill with oil, then grill the sausages until they're browned on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes.
