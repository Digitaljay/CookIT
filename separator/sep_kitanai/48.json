Make a well in the middle and add just less than 1 cup warm water. Mix with your hand or with a spoon until you can gather it together into a dough (depending on the condition of your flour, you may need a little extra water or a little extra flour to make a kneadable dough). Turn out onto a lightly floured bread board and knead for 8 to 10 minutes. Cover with a damp cloth or a plastic wrap and let stand for 30 minutes or for up to 2 hours. The longer the dough stands, the more digestible the breads.\nDivide the dough into 8 pieces and flatten each with lightly floured fingers. Continue flattening with a rolling pin until each piece is 8 inches in diameter. Once you have started rolling, roll out each bread without flipping it over. To keep the bread from sticking to your bread board, make sure that the bread is lightly floured underneath. Cover the breads with the damp towel or plastic wrap as you roll out others (make sure not to stack the rolled out breads; if you don't have enough counterspace for the breads, roll out just a few and begin cooking, rolling out the others as the breads cook).\nHeat a castiron griddle or skillet over medium-high heat. When the griddle is hot, place a chapati on the griddle, top side of the bread down first. Let cook for only 10 seconds and then gently flip to the second side. Cook on the second side until small bubbles begin to form, approximately one minute. Turn the chapati back to the first side and finish cooking (another minute approximately). At this stage, a perfect chapati will start to balloon. This process can be helped along by gently pressing on the bread. The bread is hot, so we find the easiest method is to use a small cotton cloth or a paper towel wadded up to protect your finger tips. Gently press down on a large bubble forcing the bubble to extend itself wider. If the bread starts to burn on the bottom before it has ballooned, move the bread (with the help of your paper towel) across the skillet, dislodging it from the point at which it is beginning to burn.\nWhen you are satisfied with your chapati, remove it and wrap in a clean towel.

Place 3/4 cup of the flour, the sugar, and salt in the bowl of a mixer fitted with the dough hook. Mixing on low speed, pour in the milk and yeast mixture, followed by the egg yolks and butter. Mix for a minute to combine.\nAdd the proofed sponge and the remaining 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour. Continue to beat at low speed until combined. Turn up the speed slightly and knead the dough for 4 to 5 minutes, or until it has formed a ball and cleans the sides of the bowl. If the dough seems wet, it may be necessary to add 1 to 2 more tablespoons flour. Cover the bowl and let the dough proof overnight in the refrigerator.\nTo shape the doughnuts: Place the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface and roll it out to a 1/2-inch thickness. Cut out the doughnuts using a 2-inch doughnut cutter, or a 2-inch biscuit cutter (in which case, you will also need a 3/4-inch cutter to make the hole). Place the doughnuts and doughnut holes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cover the doughnuts with a sheet of plastic wrap that has been sprayed with nonstick spray.\nAt this point, the doughnuts can be frozen for several days, refrigerated, or allowed to rise at room temperature. If they're frozen, defrost them and then allow them to rise at room temperature for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. They can be refrigerated for several hours or overnight, to rise slowly. When you remove them from the refrigerator, uncover them and let them finish proofing in a warm place for 20 to 30 minutes. If they have not been refrigerated or frozen, they should rise at room temperature in about 15 minutes. Once proofed, they will have risen to approximately 3/4 inch.\nTo cook the doughnuts: In a deep heavy saucepan large enough to hold half the doughnuts and holes at a time, heat canola oil for deep-frying to 325 degrees F. Add half the doughnuts and holes to the oil and cook for approximately 30 seconds on the first side. Flip the doughnuts and fry for 1 minute on the second side, then turn back to the first side to cook for an additional 30 seconds, or until a deep golden brown. Remove the doughnuts, drain them briefly on paper towels, and toss them in a bowl with the cinnamon sugar. Repeat with the remaining doughnuts.\nTo complete: Remove the semifreddo from the freezer a few minutes before serving to soften slightly.

Set aside, covered, for 30 to 45 minutes, until the lobsters in the pot are cool enough to handle. Retain the broth for use in the sauce. Break off the tails and claws from each of the lobsters, and crack the shells, taking care to retain any liquid released and add it to the broth. Remove all the meat, split the tail in half lengthwise, and remove and discard the intestinal tract. Cut each half tail into 3 or 4 pieces, and halve the claw meat. Arrange all the meat in a gratin dish lined with plastic wrap. Set aside. The recipe can be prepared ahead to this point and refrigerated.

Cut each body into 4 or 5 pieces and add to the pan along with the shells from the tails and claws. Saute over high heat for 10 to 12 minutes, until the shells begin to brown and become crusty, and most of the moisture has evaporated. Add 2 tablespoons cognac to the pan and carefully light it to flambe the shells. Add the onion, carrot, and celery and cook with the shells for 4 to 5 minutes.

Unwrap the plastic wrap from the reserved lobster and pour the butter gently over the meat. Season with salt and pepper and sprinkle on the tarragon. Bring the plastic wrap back over the lobster meat so the meat is held tightly together and can soak up the butter.\nFor the souffle: Make the bechamel sauce by melting 3 tablespoons butter in a saucepan and cooking until it is light brown in color to give some intensity to the sauce. Add the flour and mix well. Stir in the milk and season with salt and pepper. Mix well with a whisk, bring to a boil, and boil for about 30 seconds. Continue whisking while adding 4 egg yolks to the hot bechamel and stir well to incorporate. (Reserve the remaining 2 egg yolks for another recipe.)\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly butter a 6 or 7-cup gratin dish and sprinkle with 2 to 3 tablespoon of the grated Parmesan, tilting the dish so the cheese sticks to the butter and coats the bottom and sides. Tap out and reserve any excess cheese for use on top of the souffle. Beat the 6 egg whites until firm but not dry. Add about 1/3 of the egg whites to the bechamel and mix with a whisk to incorporate. Add the remaining whites and the Gruyere and fold in with a rubber spatula. It is important to work quickly so the beaten egg white gets incorporated into the mixture without getting grainy. Pour into the prepared dish and sprinkle on the remaining Parmesan.

The lobster should be warm but not hot. If heated too fast or at too high a temperature, it toughens. Just before serving, heat 6 soup plates in the oven.\nDivide the lobster meat among the warm soup plates, bring the sauce to a boil, and spoon it over the lobster meat in each plate.

Try to distribute the strands evenly on the sides and bottom of the bowl, making sure to come all the way to the rim, however, not so thick that you can't see the bowl through the sugar.\nUsing a sharp chef's knife, slice the edge of the cage clean by scraping the blade of the knife along the rim of the bowl. Set aside to cool, about 5 minutes.\nTo unmold the cage, place your thumbs on the outside of the bowl and your fingers on the inside of the sugar cage. Gently pull the cage loose from the side and bottom of the bowl; you will be able to see the cage release from the inside of the bowl. You will need to apply this gentle pressure all around the inside of the bowl. Once the cage has released from the bowl, carefully lift it out and place it over the dessert. If the sugar is still too warm, the cage may begin to collapse. A good idea is to release the cage from the bowl but leave it in the bowl until it has cooled completely. This will ensure that it keeps its shape.
