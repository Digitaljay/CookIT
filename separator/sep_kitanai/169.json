Dissolve the cocoa into the espresso. Stir the buttermilk into the cocoa mixture and set aside to cool. Whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt. In another bowl, beat the butter with an electric mixer at medium speed for about 6 minutes, while gradually adding the sugar. (Use the paddle attachment for a stand mixer.) The butter mixture should be light and fluffy. Slowly add the eggs and vanilla to the butter, while continuing to beat. Be sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl as you go, so all the ingredients get incorporated. Fold the flour and cocoa mixtures into the butter mixture with a rubber spatula, alternating from flour to cocoa in the following order: 1/3 flour mixture; 1/2 cocoa mixture; 1/3 flour mixture; 1/2 cocoa mixture; 1/3 flour mixture. Do not overmix!\nPour half of the finished batter into each of the cake pans and level the tops with the spatula. Bake for 40 minutes in the center of the oven, rotating halfway through. Check with a wooden toothpick for doneness.

Add the powdered sugar and beat until spreadable.\nWith a serrated knife halve the two layers making 4. Place 1 cake layer top down on the rack and spread 1/3 of the buttercream to the edges of the layer. Top the first cake layer with another and repeat with the buttercream. Continue layering with the remaining layers and buttercream, ending with cake. Refrigerate covered in plastic wrap for at least 3 hours and up to overnight.\nRemove the cake from the refrigerator and carefully transfer to a wire rack over a sheet pan. (Line the space under the rack with some old newspaper, for easy cleanup.)\nTo make the ganache, chop the butter and scatter it into the chocolate pieces in a large bowl. Heat the cream and corn syrup in a saucepan over moderate heat. As soon as the cream mixture begins to boil, pour it over the chocolate mixture and begin stirring vigorously. When the chocolate has melted and is combined thoroughly with the cream, stir in the vanilla. Quickly begin pouring the ganache over the top of the cake, allowing it to flow down and cover the sides. (You may use a metal frosting spatula to smooth the top and sides.) Pack the chopped peanuts onto the ganache to cover the sides of the cake, leaving the chocolate on top exposed. Store in the refrigerator.\nServing suggestions: I like to reserve a little of the buttercream and a handful of whole honey roasted peanuts to decorate the top of the cake. Try using a star tip to pipe points of buttercream in a circle, bordering the top of the cake.

With an electric beater, beat together the egg yolks, just 1/4 cup of the sugar (reserving the rest), and vanilla until the mixture becomes a pale yellow and thickens. Sift cake flour over the egg yolk mixture and set aside briefly. Wash and dry the beaters. In a separate metal bowl, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar together and gradually beat in the balance of the sugar until stiff peaks form. To the egg yolk/flour bowl, fold in 1/3 of the beaten egg whites until just barely combined. Repeat 2 more times with each of the remaining 1/3 of the beaten egg whites. Spread into jelly roll pan and bake in oven for about 15 minutes or until the surface is golden brown and springs back when touched. Let cake cool in pan.\nWhile the cake is cooling, it would be a good idea to make room in the freezer for the sheet cake and ice cream.\nWhen the cake is completely cool, peel off the browned surface of the cake. (You can do this simply by loosening it and rolling it off.) Firmly press a flat baking sheet without edges (which is the same size or larger than the baking tin) against the top edges of the baking tin and invert the cake so it is transferred to the flat sheet and remove the parchment paper. Then cut the cake in half lengthwise and in half crosswise. Two of these quarters will be dedicated to the top and bottom of the baked Alaska, respectively. Using a broad thin spatula, slide one of these quarters to a flat oven safe platter.\nLoosen the carton from the half-gallon of ice cream and place the entire brick onto the cake on the platter. Then slide the other quarter onto the top of the brick of ice cream and put the whole platter into the freezer.\nThe remaining 2 pieces of cake will fit over the sides and ends of the brick of ice cream. Cut the cake to fit the dimensions of the sides and ends utilizing the most efficient positioning which will result in the fewest number of cuts. You will need 2 rectangles measuring approximately 8 inches by 3 inches and 2 rectangles measuring approximately 8 by 5-inches. Cover with plastic wrap if you are not using these immediately, to prevent them from drying out.\nSome of the meringue topping will be used to secure these rectangles to the sides of the ice cream.\nTo make the meringue topping, make a slurry with 2/3 cup water gradually whisked into a small saucepan to which you have added cornstarch and sugar. Bring to a boil over medium heat, whisking constantly. As it thickens and becomes translucent, cover and remove it from the heat. In a scrupulously clean large metal or glass bowl, with scrupulously clean beaters, beat the egg whites (they must be at room temperature) until foamy. Add vanilla and cream of tartar and beat until soft peaks form. Very gradually beat in sugar on high until glossy and stiff peaks form, but do not allow it to get dry. Reduce the speed of the beater to low and gradually add the cornstarch slurry. When it has all been added increase speed to medium for about 10 seconds.\nThis can be refrigerated with plastic wrap on top for a short while before use.\nImmediately before serving the Baked Alaska, make sure your oven rack is in a position to provide enough clearance for the meringue and pre-heat oven to 425 degrees F. Remove the sheet cake and ice cream from the freezer. Using some of the meringue as a \"glue\" position the pre-cut pieces of cake to fit the sides and the ends of the brick of ice cream. Then spread the rest of the meringue in a thick layer over the entire assembly, swirling it decoratively with the back of a spoon, and being sure to cover the lower edge of the cake on all sides so the meringue touches the pan base.

Stir in the baking powder, taking care to mix well. Add the eggs and egg yolk and stir well. Add the flours and gently stir until a smooth ball forms. Wrap the dough in plastic and put in the fridge for at least 1 hour.\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees F and line a baking sheet (or sheets) with parchment paper (no cooking spray).\nOn a floured surface, roll out tennis ball-size pieces of dough to about 1/4 inch thick and cut out the shapes you want.

Let the cookies cool on a wire rack, then decorate them however you like with Royal Icing and your favorite sprinkles.\nUsing a stand mixer and the whisk attachment, whip most of the powdered sugar with most of the other ingredients. Whip for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the royal icing holds its shape and is bright white (not translucent). If it is too soft, add more powdered sugar. If it is too stiff, add a bit more liquid, drop by drop. If you are using only one color, add a few drops of the color at this point and keep whipping until you have the shade you want; otherwise, proceed to the next step.\nTo store royal icing, the ideal way is to scrape it out of the bowl and into a plastic, disposable piping bag, then leave it at room temperature. Don't cut the bag until you're ready to use the royal icing, and don't overfill the bag--you want enough room to tie the back of the bag off to keep the royal icing airtight. If any air comes into contact with the royal icing, it gets hard and that part of the icing is useless. Never attempt to mix the hard bits back into the royal icing--you'll ruin the whole batch. The other accepted method of storing royal icing is to scrape it into a plastic or ceramic bowl, and cover it with a wet paper towel. This method works, but it wastes both paper towels and royal icing. It's also just annoying. When you're piping small designs, you want to use very small parchment piping bags. It's easy to stick the nose of a large piping bag into a smaller one and extract exactly how much you'll need. When the icing is in a bowl, you have to use a spoon to get it out. The spoon is difficult to get into a piping bag, and you'll keep using spoons and wasting royal icing. Get with the times people.
