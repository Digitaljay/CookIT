It is ready to eat now or you can add chocolate to the outside of the brittle.\nTo cover with chocolate: You can use a variety of methods to apply chocolate to the brittle. You could simply place some chocolate into a cornet and drizzle the chocolate over the cool brittle. You could also use a dipping fork to dip each piece of brittle in the chocolate. Whatever method you use, allow the chocolate to set and it is ready to serve.\nFrom Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres\nThe Cornet: A cornet is a small piping bag made from parchment paper. It is usually used to make fine decorations.\nCut an 8 by 12 by 14 1/2-inch triangle from a sheet of parchment paper. Hold the middle of the long side of the triangle between two fingers of 1 hand. Take the tip of the triangle on the short, wide end and roll it toward the other tip of that same end while simultaneously pulling it in an upward motion. The tip of a cone will form where your thumb and finger hold it on the long side.\nRelease your grip from the long side, so that you are now holding the 2 corners where they meet. The paper will already resemble a partially formed cone.\nRoll the remaining tail until it is completely rolled into a cone. There will be 1 point sticking up from the open end. Fold it inside toward the center, and crease the fold. Now you should have a cornet. To close the cornet once it has been filled, fold it away from the seam; this will keep the seam from opening.

Heat resistant molds can filled with the cookie dough and baked in the oven. Non-heat resistant molds can be used to mold the cookie dough only. If you are using non-heat resistant molds, make sure you are using cookie dough that won't spread too much in the oven.\nPaint melted candy melts into the details of the mold. Allow the detailed areas to harden. Fill in the mold with a background color, making sure that you can't see through the mold when you hold it up to a light. Be careful not to overfill the mold with the candy melts. If you fill the mold completely, the candy top will not fit snugly against the cookie base. Place the filled molds in the freezer until the candy is cold. Remove the molds from the freezer and carefully release the candy. Secure the top to the cookie with a dab of melted candy melts.\nLuster dust brushed on the candy tops adds a beautiful sheen to your cookies.\nTinted Royal Icing Cookies: Outline the area of the cookie to be covered using a pastry bag with a small round tip or a zip top bag with the corner snipped off and quickly fill-in the center of the cookie with royal icing.\nWhen icing sets, outline and fill-in adjoining areas with additional colors of royal icing.\nDetails can be piped on in complementary or contrasting colors of royal icing after the base color has hardened.\nFondant Molded Cookies: You can use either heat resistant or non-heat resistant molds for these cookies. Heat resistant molds can filled with the cookie dough and baked in the oven. Non-heat resistant molds can be used to mold the cookie dough only. If you are using non-heat resistant molds, make sure you are using cookie dough that won't spread too much in the oven.\nUsing the same molds you used to bake the cookies to decorate these cookies. Lightly dust the mold with powdered sugar and press fondant into the molds. Using a small offset spatula carefully remove the fondant. Secure the fondant to the cookie using a small bit of buttercream icing.\nYou can create detail in the fondant covered cookies by using different colors. Press small bits of fondant into the details of the mold you want to highlight and then fill in with a background color.\nLuster dust applied to the fondant adds an extra special sparkle to your cookies.\nThe fondant can be painted with food coloring or with edible food color pens to add extra details to the cookies.", "ingredients": ["Baked sugar cookies in your favorite shapes", "Fondant", "Tinted royal icing", "Edible glitter", "Colored sugar", "Nonpareils", "Dragees", "Plastic candy molds", "Pastry bags and tips", "Food coloring", "Paint brushes"], "title": "Decorated Sugar Cookies", "picture_link": null}, "22682": {"instructions": "Line a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap, leaving at least a 2-inch overhang on all sides.

Use metal rulers to outline the mold that you would like to make. For my centerpiece, I used some ceramic art souvenirs I bought in Mexico. Place the rulers on a parchment paper lined sheet pan, and place the item to be molded in the center of that space. Pour the melted Elastack over the item to be molded until it is completely covered. Let this set for about 30 minutes until the Elastack hardens. When set, remove the original piece. Now the mold is ready to use. Make the cocoa pods: Use a ladle to fill the cocoa pod mold with white chocolate. When it is full, empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the mold clean on the side of the bowl and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Unmold. Repeat with as many cocoa pods as you would like. If you are using the cocoa pod as a container to hold something, do not glue the 2 halves together. Otherwise, use tempered chocolate to glue the 2 halves together. If you want to paint the cocoa pods, there are 2 methods. The first is to mix together a few tablespoons of the cocoa butter with a small amount of powdered food color. It will be easier if you use a yogurt machine to store and warm your paints. Use a paintbrush to paint the inside of the mold, applying color where you are inspired to do so. Then, follow the instructions that follow to make a mold. The second method is to use an airbrush. If you use an airbrush, simply place a few drops of color in the receptacle of the airbrush and decorate as you are inspired.\nMake the mask: Use a ladle to fill the cocoa pod mold with chocolate. When it is full, empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the mold clean on the side of the bowl and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. Give the mold another coat so it will be especially strong. Follow the same procedures. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Unmold. Repeat with as many masks as you would like. Use the paintbrush techniques described above to paint the mask. Then use the airbrush to spray color over the face. If the airbrush splatters paint onto the chocolate surface, blend it with a paintbrush. Make the base: Use flexible aluminum strips or large cake ring to form a base. The base I made was 10-inches in diameter. Place the ring on a parchment paper lined surface. Pour tempered chocolate inside the ring to form a 1-inch-thick layer. When the chocolate has set, remove the ring and peel off the parchment paper.\nMake a support pole: Roll a piece of acetate into a tube that is 22-inches long and 3-inches in diameter and tape it closed. Set the tube on end and fill with chocolate. When it is full, invert the tube over the bowl of chocolate allowing the excess chocolate to flow back into the bowl. Let set. When the chocolate has set, repeat this step a few more times. You want the tube to be quite sturdy, as the rest of the centerpiece will depend on it. Allow the chocolate tube to set until hard. Remove the acetate. Use a hot knife to trim the base of the tube so it is flat. Then use the knife to scar the bottom. You want to make it somewhat textured so it will form a better seal to the base. Use tempered chocolate to glue the pole onto the base. Position it well so you can rest the molded chocolate against it. Repeat this procedure making another tube. Use a hot sharp chef's knife to cut the second tube into 2 equal pieces. A diagonal cut will be more pleasing to the eye in the finished presentation. To do this, heat the knife under very hot water and wipe it dry. Hold the knife blade against the side of the chocolate where you want to make the cut. Do not press on the knife or the chocolate will break. Allow the heat of the knife to \"cut\" through the chocolate by melting it. Use tempered chocolate to glue the shorter pieces to the center pole. Then, glue the center pole onto the base. Position it well so you can rest the molded chocolate against it.\nUse a paintbrush to paint the support poles with tempered chocolate. This will give the support pole the illusion that is made from wood. Use the newly made Elastack molds. Use a ladle to fill the mold cavity with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the mold clean with a sharp knife. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. To unmold, invert the mold and peel the mold from the chocolate. Repeat to make more chocolate molds of the pieces in your design. I painted 1 of the ceramic pieces with a mixture of vegetable oil and powdered food colors. Then I used a towel to wipe a bit of the color off to make the painting look antique. Use tempered chocolate to adhere the chocolate pieces to the support pole. If you are using the cocoa pod as a container to hold the cookies, place cookies inside the bottom and rest the other 1/2 of the pod on top. You can also tie a pod closed with a ribbon to make a unique gift.", "ingredients": ["5 pounds bittersweet chocolate, tempered", "3 pounds white chocolate, tempered", "Cocoa butter", "Powdered food coloring, as desired", "Vegetable oil"], "title": "Mexican Totem", "picture_link": "es0dPSykr4mb3ewSq1ZjY.vLpy4EA6a"}, "22710": {"instructions": "For the steamed lobster meat and lobster stock: Fill a large bowl with ice and cold water, and set it aside.\nIn a 4- or 6-quart cast iron Dutch oven, or other heavy-bottomed pot with a tight-fitting lid, combine the tomatoes, 2 cups of the wine, the 1/2 cup of the water, sliced onions, peppercorns and tarragon.

First, pull off claws and legs. Break legs and check for meat. Sucking is okay. Some like to save the claws for last because they are rather dessert-like, although the \"lump\" meat from the body is prized most. Next, turn the crab on its back. You will see an elongated part of the shell that looks like a \"T.\" Some call it the key, even though it doesn't look very much like one. The female key is plumper; the male's is more elongated. Pull the key back, breaking it off, which makes the rest of the shell easy to remove. Now the body of the crab is shell-less. You will now see the long rib-like strips on either side of the cavity. These are the crab's gills. Edible, but not very good. Pull them off, and you will more easily be able to break the crab in half. When you do this, you will most likely now see a good amount of white, fleshy \"lump\" crab meat. Continue opening the small sections to expose more meat. You will not need mallets or hammers for this. When you are ready for the claws, break them in half at the joint. Take a wooden mallet and whack the large half hard. Don't be shy.\nOther helpful hints: Don't wear your Sunday best. If it tastes good, you can eat it. Plates and cutlery are unnecessary; the brown paper is a communal plate. Bibs are for babies. When finished, steamed hand towels are very welcome. The easiest way to dispose of the mess is to roll up the brown paper with all the shells, etc. on it -- taking care to \"rescue\" knives, bowls, etc. first -- and discard in outdoor trash can. The garbage may attract animals, so be sure to keep the lid on tight. Note: Leftover crabs are excellent cold, served with a mayonnaise based dipping sauce.

If you are drinking a big, intense wine, choose a big, intense cheese. For example, if you've chosen Petit Sirah (usually big, deep--colored and full bodied), choose a Gorgonzola, the creamy, classic Italian cow's milk blue cheese that comes in Mountain (aged) and Dolce (sweet) varieties.\nIf you are serving a Sauvignon Blanc (which tends to be crisp and light - medium bodied), pair it with goat cheese, light and delightfully tart--even tangy. Also, the more acidic your wine is, the higher the fat content of the cheese needs to be (generally).\nA young, fresh goat cheese, goes well with Robert Mondavi Winery Fume Blanc Reserve or the Luna Pinot Grigio. Or try, St. Paulin (also known as Port Salut), good company for fruit and light wine.\nBuy a well-aged Brie, Camembert or Cambozola for Chardonnay.

What contrast for the mouth!\nWith numerous varieties to choose from, cheese's companionship with both sweet and savory ingredients can make serving the ultimate cheese course a creative and colorful celebration every time. Have fun and experiment with your favorite flavors!\nNext to buying good cheese, the single most important element of serving a great cheese course is the temperature of the cheese when you serve it--room temperature! Set the cheese out at least 3 hours before serving time. It really is true that $5 cheese will taste like $20 cheese at the right temperature and $20 cheese will taste like $5 cheese at the wrong temperature.
