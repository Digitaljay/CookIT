Once boiling, shut off the heat. Rinse out the mason jar you'll be using for yogurt with some of the hot water. Fill the jar with more hot water and set it aside to preheat. All lids, bowls, spoons, forks or funnels should get a quick dunk in hot water too.\nFill the cooler with hot water to about 2 inches. Fill the remaining 3 jars with hot water, seal tightly and set in the cooler. Shut the cooler lid to allow the whole thing to preheat. This is your incubation chamber, your fermentation vessel, your magic box.\nPlace the yogurt (your starter) in a medium bowl and set it aside to allow it to warm to room temperature. (Resist the impulse to add more starter. Though it seems like a good idea, it actually produces a thinner, more fragile yogurt.)\nMilking: Run a little tap water in a small, heavy saucepan. Swirl it around to coat the interior, and discard (the water, not the saucepan). This small step reduces the adhesion of milk proteins to the metal, minimizing scorching.\nAdd the milk and half-and-half to the saucepan and warm slowly over medium-low heat until the milk reaches 185 to 190 degrees F. Take it slow, 20 or more minutes is a-ok. The slower you warm the milk, the smoother the final result. Stir frequently with a rubber spatula, being sure to run the spatula over the bottom and sides of the saucepan. All this attention reduces the formation of milk \"skin\" (though don't stress any that does form) and limits the sticking and scorching of milk solids. You'll know the milk is at or near its target temperature when you see steam coming off the surface and small bubbles forming at the edges. Once the milk has hit its target temperature, remove it from the heat to cool while you finish preparing your incubation chamber.\nFermenting: Check the temperature of the water in the cooler (probably still quite hot) and add enough water, warm or cool as needed, to get the whole thing to 115 degrees F (about the temperature of very warm tap water). No higher, please. Really, 115 and not any higher. It is not worth running the risk of killing off the lactic acid bacteria in your starter.\nWhen the temperature of the milk has dropped to 115 degrees, pour about half a cup (no need to be precise) into the bowl with your starter yogurt. (If the milk has dropped below 115, just gently heat it back to temperature before adding it to the starter.) Whisk with a fork to dissolve the yogurt, and then add the mixture back to the saucepan.\nEmpty the preheated mason jar-the one you set aside for yogurt-of its hot water. Now, pour in contents and stir well. Seal the jar tightly and transfer it to the cooler. Adjust the water level in the cooler to reach just shy of the lids.\nClose the cooler and stow it someplace peaceful and warm, away from any potential jostling, meddling or peeking. Now comes the hard part: the waiting. Yogurt wants, needs, stillness for proper coagulation. You, on the other hand, will be overcome by the urge to check the set, take the temperature, offer words of encouragement. Stop! Give the milk its 'me' time. Let it meditate. It will reward you with yogurt.\nSix to eight hours later, go ahead and have a look. Take the jar out of the cooler, remove the lid, and peer into the mystery before you. What was liquid should now be semi-solid. Try a little. If it tastes like yogurt and you like what you taste, refrigerate it and call it a day.\nMore likely, though, the yogurt will taste a little flat. The texture might be good, but the flavor will have little of the lactic tang that makes yogurt so distinctive. Instead, I encourage you to give long, slow fermentation a chance. Though it seems kind of scary-won't it spoil?-time allows for all sorts of wonderful flavors to develop, and for more lactose to be converted to lactic acid (which actually has a preservative effect). With slow fermentation you get fuller flavored, tangier yogurt.\nSo, once you've tasted and tested, raise the water in the cooler back to 100 to 105 degrees F, and return the yogurt to the cooler. Ferment for another 12 to 15 hours. Taste again. I got my best results after 22 hours of total incubation-with most of the last 10 hours hovering between 85 and 95 degrees-but yogurt is highly variable, and you could take it even further if you think it would benefit from still more acidity. Let your palate guide you.\nWhen through fermenting, refrigerate your yogurt for 3 hours, to allow its structure to firm up. The end result should be almost pudding-like, closer to Greek yogurt than to conventional yogurt.\nAnd there you have it, in a few simple steps, you, you, have saved one of the most perishable foods in nature from the forces of rot, and converted it into something durable and delicious.", "ingredients": ["1 scant tablespoon plain yogurt (label must list \"live\" or \"active\" cultures)", "2 1/2 cups whole milk", "3/4 cups half-and-half"], "title": "Yogurt Yogurt", "picture_link": null}, "54812": {"instructions": "Watch how to make this recipe.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Using a chef's spoon or large spoon, constantly move the sausage from the bottom of the pot. Be careful not to burn the meat. (Normally I use Manda's sausage because it has little fat, however at this point you may want to drain off all of the excess grease to reduce the fat content from the dish.)\nAdd the thigh meat and brown the chicken on all sides. Again use the spoon to scrape the meat from sticking and burning to the bottom of the pot. Browning the sausage and chicken meats should take 20 minutes. Be careful not to over cook the thigh meat to the point that it shreds.\nLower the heat to medium and add the onions and garlic; saute for about 15 minutes or until the onions are very limp and \"clear\". Scrape the bottom of the pot to remove all the \"graton\". This is where the jambalaya gets its distinct brown color and taste.\nAdd the tasso, thyme, basil and black and white pepper. Simmer over low heat for 10 minutes. This will give the seasonings time to release their oils and flavors.\nAt this point the jambalaya concentrate can be transferred to smaller containers, cooled to room temperature, covered and refrigerated for future use. (This is what we do commercially; it allows the seasonings to marry.)\nWhen you are ready to cook the jambalaya, add the stock to the concentrate and bring to a rolling boil. Add the rice, reduce the heat to medium and gently break up the rice. Using the stainless steel paddle, continue to insure that the rice is not sticking to the bottom of the pot; this is very important!\nAfter about 5 minutes, fold in the parsley. Continue to scrape the pot to insure that no rice sticks to the bottom. When the jambalaya returns to a boil, reduce heat to the lowest possible setting and simmer, covered, for at least 25 minutes. Do not remove the cover while the rice is steaming.\nIf Manda's brand sausage is not available, any lean smoked sausage can be substituted. You may have to remove any excess grease from the pot after frying down an unknown sausage.\nFor a richer jambalaya substitute turkey stock for the chicken stock called for above.\nIf no stocks are available, then chicken soup base can be used. Be careful with your seasoning, as bases are usually full of salt.\nAlternate Method: .\nThe jambalaya is best when served directly out of the cast iron pot. While the rice is steaming, the sausage and meat will have a tendency to float to the surface of the jambalaya. Therefore, after the rice has steamed for 25 minutes, use the paddle to gently fold in the meat and seasonings into the cooked rice. This should only be done once or twice, the rice will loose a lot of heat and the rice will break apart.\nAlso note, I do not add salt to my jambalaya. This is because I like to use herbs, tasso and seasonings to satisfy the need for salt. I would suggest having the table set with salt shakers and a selection of hot pepper sauces.\nPlate Presentation: .", "ingredients": ["2 pounds mild smoked pork sausage, or any lean high-quality smoked pork sausage, sliced 1/4-inch thick", "2 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thigh meat", "1 1/2 pounds onions, diced", "2 tablespoons minced fresh garlic", "1 pound tasso, cubed", "3/4 tablespoon whole fresh thyme leaves", "3/4 tablespoon chopped fresh sweet basil leaves", "1/2 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper", "1/2 tablespoon white pepper", "1/2 tablespoon red pepper flakes", "1/3 gallon chicken stock", "1 1/4 pounds long-grain rice", "1 tablespoon freshly chopped curly parsley leaves"], "title": "Cajun Chicken and Sausage Jambalaya", "picture_link": "9Etk/HDQGK1P9ObkxC9295N39W59s9."}, "54881": {"instructions": "In a small sauce pan, add 1 cup dashi with the tamari and honey.
