Turn the heat right down, place a lid on so it's ajar (otherwise the pan might spit hot polenta at you!) and simmer for 50 minutes, stirring it as often as you can. If it starts to become too thick, add some more hot water.\nRemove the birds from the oven, lift them out of the pan and keep warm. Put the pan on the burner, pour in the wine and simmer gently to make a quick sauce. Then see to the polenta - it'll need some serious perking up now. Stir in about 3/4 of the butter and all the grated Parmesan. Once smooth, taste and season if required. It should now be delicious! Spoon all the polenta onto a big board or platter, spread it out evenly and put to 1 side to firm up a little.\nGive your sauce a stir and add the rest of the butter. Strain it through a sieve into a pan, pressing down hard. Cut the bigger birds into drumstick thighs and breast pieces and place with all the other birds on top of your polenta. Slice the sausages and add to the pile. Spoon the red wine sauce over the top and finish with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. Put the board in the middle of the table and let everyone dive in.

After you separate the eggs, make sure you allow the egg whites to come to room temperature before whipping. Room temperature egg whites whip better and faster if at room temperature.\nFor the meringue cookies: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Prep 2 half sheet pans with parchment or silicone baking mats.\nSift together your almond meal and powdered sugar and set aside.\nIn the bowl of a standing mixer, or with an electric hand mixer, beat the egg whites on low speed until foamy. Begin sprinkling in the meringue powder as you beat. Then increase the speed to medium and beat until soft peaks form. If adding food coloring at the point, you can divide the meringue, add to a separate bowl and dye as desired (see Cook's Note, below). Beat to combine. When you get to soft peaks (the peaks will curl when the whisk is lifted from the mixture), carefully proceed; you want firm glossy peaks in your meringue, you do not want to beat all the way to stiff peaks (peaks stand up straight when a whisk is lifted from the mixture).\nAdd a third of the almond mixture, folding it in gently. Once combined, add the remaining almond flour in 2 batches. Be very, very gentle! Make sure to fully incorporate all your ingredients, but do not over-fold.\nSpoon the mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a plain 1/2-inch tip.

The mixture should be thick, smooth, and homogenous.\nPour the heavy cream, milk, and remaining sugar into a non-reactive 3-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan, place it over medium-high heat, and bring to a boil. Temper the egg mixture with the hot mixture by carefully pouring about 1/3 of the hot mixture into the egg mixture. Whisk immediately to keep the eggs from scrambling. Pour the tempered egg mixture back into the saucepan and place over medium heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula. The liquid will begin to thicken. When it reaches 182 degrees on a candy thermometer and is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, it is finished and should be removed from the heat. If you do not have a thermometer, you can tell that it is finished by using the following method: In one quick motion, dip the spatula into the creme anglaise and hold it down horizontally in front of you. With the tip of your finger, wipe a clean line down the center of the spatula. If the trail keeps its shape, the creme anglaise is ready. If the trail fills with liquid, cook it for another minute and repeat the test. The objective is to remove the creme anglaise from the heat just before it boils. If the creme anglaise boils, the egg yolks will scramble. If this happens, you can still use it if you mix it with a hand-held immersion blender, food processor, or a blender. You will need a blade to liquefy the scrambled egg pieces. Remove from the heat.\nPlace the chopped chocolate in a medium-size mixing bowl and make a ganache by pouring the creme anglaise over the chocolate in two or three additions. Use a hand whisk to incorporate fully after each addition. The ganache should be thick, shiny, and smooth. Whisk in the Grand Marnier. Place in the refrigerator to cool and set. As the cream cools, the cocoa butter in the chocolate will harden and hold everything together. The cream will also become more flavorful as it cools.
