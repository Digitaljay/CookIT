Slide the baking sheet into the center of the oven and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Remove the pans from the oven and allow the cakes to cool briefly. Invert the cakes from the pans onto a baking sheet fitted with a wire rack and peel off the parchment paper. Allow them to cool for at least 45 minutes before frosting.\nFrosting:\nPour some water, about 2 inches deep, into a saucepan to create a makeshift double boiler. Put the pan on the stove and bring the water to a gentle simmer. Dip the instant-read thermometer into the simmering water to clean any impurities off the end and to test that the thermometer works.\nIn a clean, large mixing bowl, combine the 5 tablespoons of cool water, cream of tartar, sugar, egg whites and corn syrup. Gently lower the bowl over the simmering water. Turn off the heat under the pot. Use an electric hand beater to whip the whites over the water. Do not leave the egg white mixture unattended or stop beating any time during this process.\nAfter about 3 minutes, remove the bowl from the heat, set the beater down and quickly take the temperature of the egg whites. You want them to reach 140 degrees F. If you measure the temperature before they reach that point, immediately put the bowl of whites back over the water and resume beating until they are finished, an additional 2 to 3 minutes.\nRemove the bowl from the water and fold in the vanilla extract.
