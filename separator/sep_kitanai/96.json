Combine 1 tablespoon water with the egg white and brush this mixture in an even coat all over the dough. Allow the dough to rise, about 15 minutes.\nBake the dough until the buns are nicely golden brown on top and 190 degrees F in the center, rotating the pan halfway through the baking time, about 20 minutes total.

Slice down the center of each tube of dough using a serrated knife (this is the cool part). You will lose half a tube on each end, hence yielding only 12 buns and 2 awesome slices of rye bread that you will eat immediately. The place where the tubes meet is now the center of the bun. They should split naturally but you can use a serrated knife to help them, if you choose.\nNow you have a beautiful bread wall that you can butter and toast. Wrap the buns in plastic or a re-sealable plastic bag until ready to use. Freeze the buns immediately if you will not be using them the same day.\nCombine the Garlic Mayo, pickles, ketchup, chili sauce, Worcestershire, lemon juice and sprinkle with salt.

Slowly drizzle in the olive oil until emulsified. You will hear a \"slapping\" sound from the blender or food processor when the oil starts to emulsify. Blend the mixture until all of the oil is incorporated; the consistency should be that of a heavy mayonnaise. Use the mayo immediately or refrigerate and keep for up to a month.\nThis recipe can also be made by combining 1 cup store-bought mayo, 1 clove crushed garlic and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.\nCombine the Garlic Mayo, Creole mustard, light brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, scallion, buttermilk, salt, hot sauce, black pepper and jalapenos in a medium mixing bowl.

Sterilizing jars is the first step of preserving foods.\nTips:\nJars should be made from glass and free of any chips or cracks. Preserving or canning jars are topped with a glass, plastic, or metal lid, which has a rubber seal. Two piece lids are best for canning, as they vacuum seal when processed.\nTo sterilize jars, before filling with jams, pickles, or preserves, wash jars and lids with hot, soapy water. Rinse well and arrange jars and lids open sides up, without touching, on a tray. Boil the jars and lids in a large saucepan, covered with water, for 15 minutes.\nUse tongs when handling the hot sterilized jars, to move them from boiling water. Be sure the tongs are sterilized too, by dipping the ends in boiling water for a few minutes.\nAs a rule, hot preserves go into hot jars and cold preserves go into cold jars. All items used in the process of making jams, jellies, and preserves must be clean. This includes any towels used, and especially your hands.\nAfter the jars are sterilized, you can preserve the food. It is important to follow any canning and processing instructions included in the recipe and refer to USDA guidelines about the sterilization of canned products.", "ingredients": ["8 cups of mixed vegetables (recommended: carrots, celery, beets, cauliflower)", "2 cloves garlic", "1 tablespoon dill seeds", "1 tablespoon mustard seeds", "1 tablespoon coriander seeds", "1 tablespoon black peppercorn", "3 sprigs fresh rosemary", "2 1/2 cups sugar", "3 cups white vinegar", "2 cups water"], "title": "Homemade Pickled Veggies", "picture_link": null}, "28701": {"instructions": "Watch how to make this recipe.\nSpecial equipment: a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees F and place a rack in the center of the oven.\nFit a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate with the pie dough.
