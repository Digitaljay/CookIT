My question: Have we forgotten anything, like maybe a delicious green vegetable that belongs in our soup? I say Yes! Let's revisit \"C\" and add some Celery! 1 small bunch of celery, diced Q is also for Quarter. We need a Quarter cup of liquid; you can add water or vegetable juice for broth, which should be combined with 1 teaspoon of butter for a smooth texture. R is for Rosemary, a herb which goes wonderfully in soup. 2 teaspoons fresh Rosemary S is for Salt, Sage and Savory Spices--all things that wake up the natural flavor of our vegetable soup. 1 teaspoon each of Sage and savory Herb de Provence Salt to taste T is for Tomato, one of my very favorite things to put into soup 4 red Tomatoes, diced T is also for Thyme, another great herb. 1/4 teaspoon Thyme Which sounds like \"Time\", something our soup also needs.

Remove vanilla pod and discard, and refrigerate until chilled.\nFor the Sponge Cake:\nPreheat oven to 325 degrees F. Grease and lay parchment paper over the bottom of a jelly roll size baking pan (17 1/2 inches by 11 1/2 inches by 1-inch deep). With an electric beater, beat together the egg yolks, just 1/4 cup of the sugar (reserving the rest), and vanilla until the mixture becomes a pale yellow and thickens. Sift cake flour over the egg yolk mixture and set aside briefly. Wash and dry the beaters.\nIn a separate metal bowl, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar together and gradually beat in the balance of the sugar until stiff peaks form. To the egg yolk/flour bowl, fold in 1/3 of the beaten egg whites until just barely combined. Repeat two more times with each of the remaining 2/3 of the beaten egg whites.\nSpread into jelly roll pan and bake in oven for about 15 minutes or until the surface is golden brown and springs back when touched. Let cake cool in pan for 10 minutes and loosen the edges with a spatula or butter knife. Then, invert cake onto a similarly sized baking sheet without edges, by holding against the top edges of the jelly roll pan and flipping it over. Peel off parchment paper and let cool completely. Wash the jelly roll pan, to have ready for soaking the cake.\nFor the Strawberries and Whipped Topping:\nReserve 18 whole (but cleaned) berries. To begin the maceration process, slice the rest of the berries into a bowl, mix in the sugar, and refrigerate.\nWhip the heavy cream with an electric beater until stiff peaks form.\nCook's Note: Each individual serving will have two layers of cake. You can adjust the serving size based on the way you slice the cake. If serving in martini glasses (as was done on the episode), cut the cake into rectangles which are approximately 3 inches square (a count of 4 across the width of the sheet cake and 6 along the length of the cake). This will yield 24 rectangles for 12 servings. You can also make slightly larger servings if using a flat serving plate by cutting into 12 rectangles which are about 4 inches square. Return the cake squares to the jelly roll pan and pour the cold tea over them allowing to soak.\nTo assemble:\nUse a spatula to transfer a slice of cake to each of the serving glasses or plates. Spoon some of the macerated strawberries on top of each cake round and top with vanilla cream. Cover with the second layer of sponge cake, then more strawberries, then more vanilla cream, and top with a dollop of whipped cream around which you will arrange 3 whole strawberries and a sprig of fresh mint.", "ingredients": ["1/2 cup milk", "1/2 cup heavy cream", "1 vanilla bean, or vanilla extract, to taste (approximately 3 tablespoons)", "1/4 cup sugar", "4 egg yolks", "6 eggs, separated", "1/2 cup plus 4 teaspoons sugar", "1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "1 1/8 cups cake flour, sifted", "1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar", "1 cup cold brewed tea", "3 pints strawberries, cleaned", "1/4 cup sugar", "1/2 pint heavy cream", "6 sprigs mint, for garnish"], "title": "Strawberry Shortcake", "picture_link": "9Y3pF2kNs7yYraVNRFGQiwwZXe1Cmcm"}, "41902": {"instructions": "Watch how to make this recipe.\nSpecial equipment: Sorghum syrup is made from the sweet juice of the sorghum plant, a variety of cereal grass.

Allow the butter to cool to room temperature. It should appear milky and should be pourable and warm to the touch. In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in the cold water. Place the flour, salt, sugar, milk, and melted butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Set the mixer on medium speed and mix just until the ingredients are dispersed, about 5 seconds. Add the dissolved yeast and beat on medium-high speed until the dough is well combined and no longer sticks to the sides of the bowl, about 1 minute.\nIf the dough is too soft, add more flour, one tablespoon at a time until it is firmer. (The dough is too soft when it cannot hold its shape.) If the dough is too hard, add cold water one tablespoon at a time until it has softened. (The dough is too hard when it is difficult to mix in the mixer.)\nRemove the dough from the mixing bowl. If the dough is slightly sticky and ropy, knead it with your hands for about 30 seconds, until it is smooth. Pat it into a ball. Place the dough on a lightly floured baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and let it proof at room temperature for about 30 minutes. (This will start the fermentation process).\nPlace the dough on a lightly floured work surface and roll it out to an 8 by 15-inch rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Wrap the rectangle in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours. The cold retards the rising process, which allows for a slow fermentation. A slow fermentation helps develop the flavor of the dough.\nRemove the dough from the refrigerator, unwrap the rectangle, and place it with a long side facing you on a lightly floured work surface. Spread the softened butter evenly over the right two thirds of the dough. I like to use a large offset spatula to do this. Incorporate the butter by folding the (butterless) left third of the dough over the center, then fold the right third of the dough to the left. Now it should resemble a folded letter.\nRoll this out into another 10 by 30-inch rectangle about 1/8-inch thick. Give the dough a book fold, or double fold, by folding each short end to the middle so they meet but do not overlap. Then fold one half over the other half and, if necessary, rotate the dough so that the seam is on your right. (This process is called a book fold because the folded dough resembles a book and a double fold because the dough is folded onto itself two times.)\nWrap the folded dough in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for a minimum of 2 hours. (At this stage I usually let the dough rest overnight and finish it in the morning.)\nThe following procedure is the final step before you form the croissants or pain au chocolat. Remove the dough from the refrigerator, unwrap it, and place on a lightly floured work surface. Roll it into a 10 x 30-inch rectangle and turn it so a long side faces you. Give the dough a single fold by folding the left third of the dough over the center. Then fold the right third of the dough to the left. Now the dough should resemble a folded letter.\nWrap in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place it on a lightly floured work surface. Roll out the dough into a 10 by 36-inch rectangle about 1/4-inch thick. Keep the thickness even and the edges straight. This will make it easier to cut the croissants or pain au chocolat.\nThese puff pastry items are best eaten the day they are made.\nFollow instructions for basic dough, above.\nWith a sharp chef's knife, cut the dough into 3 1/2 by 4 1/2-inch rectangles. Lay each rectangle on a lightly floured work surface, with a long side facing you, and place about 1/2 tablespoon of the chopped chocolate in the upper third of each one. Fold that third of the dough over the chocolate.\nPlace about another 1/2 tablespoon of the chocolate along one seam of the folded dough. Fold the bottom third of the dough over the chocolate. (At this stage, they can be frozen for up to one week if well wrapped in plastic wrap. Thaw on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet overnight in the refrigerator before proceeding.)\nTurn over the pain au chocolat so the seams face down. This will keep them from opening as they bake. Place them on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet; they will get bigger as they proof and bake, so space them about 2 inches apart. Loosely cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap and allow the pain au chocolat to proof at room temperature until they have doubled in size and appear light and full of air, 1 1/2 to 3 hours depending on the temperature of the room and of the dough.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees. Make an egg wash by whisking together the egg yolks, whole egg, and milk in a small bowl until well combined. With a pastry brush, very gently coat the croissants or pain au chocolat completely with egg wash. Bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes. I love to eat both of them fresh out of the oven. If you have any leftovers, they can be stored in the freezer if well wrapped in plastic wrap for up to 2 weeks. Thaw at room temperature and warm in the oven before serving.\nFollow instructions for basic dough, above.\nUse a sharp chef's knife to cut out triangles with a 2 1/2-inch base and 10-inch sides. Lay each triangle on a lightly floured work surface with the tip facing you. Gently pull the tip toward you; this light stretch adds layers to the finished croissant without adding density. Use the palms of your hands to roll each triangle up from the base to the tip. (At this stage, they can be frozen for up to one week if well wrapped in plastic wrap. Thaw on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet overnight in the refrigerator before proceeding.)\nPlace the rolled croissants on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet. The croissants will get bigger as they proof and bake, so space them about 2 inches apart. Loosely cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap. This keeps the croissants from developing a skin while proofing and traps the heat released during fermentation, which helps them to rise. Allow the croissants to proof at room temperature until they have doubled in size and appear light and full of air; this can take anywhere from 1 1/2 to 3 hours depending on the temperature of the room and of the dough.", "ingredients": ["3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "Scant 1/4 cup (1-ounce) loosely packed fresh compressed yeast", "Generous 1/2 cup cold water", "3 1/3 cups bread flour, plus extra if needed", "2 teaspoons salt", "1/3 cup granulated sugar", "Generous 1/2 cup whole milk", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons unsalted butter at room temperature", "Pain au Chocolat, recipe follows", "Croissants, recipe follows", "2 large egg yolks", "1 large egg", "Scant 1/4 cup whole milk", "9 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped", "3 tablespoons unsalted butter", "Scant 1/4 cup (1-ounce) loosely packed fresh compressed yeast", "Generous 1/2 cup cold water", "3 1/3 cups bread flour, plus extra if needed", "2 teaspoons salt", "1/3 cup granulated sugar", "Generous 1/2 cup whole milk", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons unsalted butter at room temperature"], "title": "Croissants and Pain au Chocolat", "picture_link": null}, "41916": {"instructions": "Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F.
