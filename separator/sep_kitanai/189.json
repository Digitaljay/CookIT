Cut the bacon into 1-inch pieces and brown slowly in the casserole. Remove the bacon and set aside, and turn the heat to high. Brown the beef quickly in the bacon fat. Add olive oil if necessary. Remove the beef from the casserole and set aside with the bacon. Add the minced carrots, onions and celery and brown on medium high heat in the remaining fat. Remove the vegetables from the pot and add to the reserved beef and bacon. Add the clarified butter to the pot and sprinkle in the flour.

Stir to mix well and simmer for at least 3, preferably 4, hours, stirring occasionally. When done the meat should be very tender. Skim fat if necessary. Check for seasoning. Remove the meat from the gravy with a slotted spoon and set aside. Remove and discard the herb bouquet. Reserve the gravy in a separate container.

Add the ice water and pulse processor a few times until dough begins to clump. Do not overprocess. Scrape dough onto a board, divide in half and put each half in a plastic bag. Working through the bag, quickly press the dough into a ball. Refrigerate dough for at least 1 hour. (May be frozen at this point for future use.) Roll 1 of the balls out to about 1/8-inch thick. Butter the tart pans and line with the dough. Roll the other ball of dough out and cut circular pieces about 1/8-inch larger than the individual tart pans (or 3/8-inch if using the single 9 or 10-inch pan). The circles for the top crust of the pot pie are cut larger because there will be shrinkage when it is baked. The edges can be crimped with a fork if desired. Leftover dough can be cut into decorative shapes for the top crust.\nButter pieces of aluminum foil and line the crust in the tart pans with them. Fill the foil with dried beans or rice to a depth of about 1-inch -- this will keep the crust from puffing when it is baked empty. Place the top crust circles on a cookie sheet and prick with a fork. Bake for about 10 minutes. Crust should just start to brown. The top pieces will likely take a little less time. Remove the aluminum foil and return the beans or rice to their container. Leave the tart pan rings in place. The crust can be made up to 4 hours before the dish is assembled and served.\nAssembly: Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Once you've made it a couple of times you'll know how you like it. If there is leftover gravy, keep it warm on the stove while you bake the pie. Mix the vegetables into the stew just before you assemble the pie. Spoon the filling mixture into the partially baked pie shell. It should fill it right to the top. There may be some filling mixture left over. This is not a bad thing. Bake for about 8 to10 minutes, until the crust starts to look quite brown at the edges and the filling is bubbling.

As long as you've got some raw garlic to rub on the 'pane bruscato' (toasted bread) and some good olive oil you can make bruschetta. Anything you put on top after that, from leftover meat, shellfish or even simple anchovies - will be delicious. One of my favourite combos is leftover lamb, fresh mint and a splash of sherry vinegar... come on!\nThese roasted vegetable bruschetta are delicious and easy. All you have to do is season and dress the leftover roasted veggies carefully to bring them back to life and you've got a perfect snack or light lunch. Gennaro has his way, and I have mine!\nRoast Vegetable Mega Mix\nPop the bread on a hot griddle pan and toast it on both sides. While that's happening, use the back of a fork or knife to roughly mash up the beetroot, turnip, and parsnip on a wooden board. Season with salt and pepper, drizzle over some extra-virgin olive oil and a little splash of balsamic, then mash again. Once your bread has nice char marks on both sides, rub the cut garlic clove all over it for flavour, then spoon the mashed vegetables on top. Finely chop the parsley and scatter that on top.\nToss the salad and mint leaves in a bowl with a good pinch of salt, a splash of extra-virgin olive oil, a drizzle of balsamic and a squeeze of lemon juice. Put a pinch of the salad leaves on top of the bruschetta then shave over some Parmesan. Finish with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and serve right away with the rest of the salad on the side.\nFor the vegetables:\nIf any of your carrots, parsnips or turnips are particularly big, chop them in 1/2. You can parboil the carrots, fennel, parsnips, and baby turnips together-everything except the beets, as they'll turn everything else red! The beets also take quite a bit longer to cook, around 20 to 25 minutes.\nPut the rest of the vegetables into a large pot, cover with cold water and season well. Bring to the boil and cook for about 6 to 7 minutes until you've got part-cooked, softened bendy vegetables, and then drain in a colander and leave to steam dry.\nGet yourself a small tray, and use it to mix up each set of vegetables with their own gorgeous flavours, a few good lugs of oil and a good pinch of salt and pepper. Toss the carrots, clementines and rosemary together first and move them to a larger roasting tray so they're all together.\nThen mix your fennel with its flavours and do the same... When you get to the parsnips, keep the honey back for later. Make sure each vegetable group is separate in the roasting tray. Cover the tray with tin foil and keep in the refrigerator or the garage until your turkey is out of the oven and resting.\nWhen you are ready to cook them, preheat your oven to 375 degrees F/ 190 degrees C/ Gas 5. Roast the vegetables in the hot oven for 50 minutes to 1 hour until they are golden, crispy and beautiful looking. Five minutes before they are ready to come out of the oven take the tray out, drizzle the honey over the parsnips and jiggle the tray so they are nicely coated.\nPile all the vegetables up on a platter so they sprawl and hang all over the place. That platter is like winter in a nutshell, and every single mouthful will taste different and exciting - you'll definitely want to keep it close to you at the table.\nFor bruschetta: Put your bread slices onto a hot griddle and toast on both sides. Add the fennel to a bowl with the chopped basil leaves and most of the chile. Squeeze in the lemon juice, add a good drizzle extra-virgin olive oil, a pinch of salt and pepper and a few shavings of Parmesan, then toss everything together. Have a quick taste to make sure the seasoning is right and add a bit more lemon juice or salt, if needed.\nWhen the bread is nice and charred, rub the cut side of the garlic all over it. Drizzle with some extra-virgin olive oil then top with a small handful of your fennel mixture. Tear the mozzarella into quarters and place one on each bruschetta.
