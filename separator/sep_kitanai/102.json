Using an offset spatula to give each tier a \"crumb coat,\" ice top and sides of cake with a thin coat of soft Italian meringue. This thin layer of icing will seal the cake. Start from the center, and work toward and over the edge, making sure to spread the meringue over the sides of the tier. Let dry at room temperature for 30 minutes. To ice the cakes: Using a clean offset spatula, spread a smooth, even layer of soft Italian meringue, to coat cake entirely. Be sure to cover all exposed cake. The icing should be smooth and uniform. Place the largest tier on the serving platter. Insert 4 columns, narrow side down, into the 18-inch tier; each column should be 4 inches from the edge of the cake and evenly spaced around the cake. Fill a large pastry bag, fitted with a large star (number #869) tip, with a freshly made batch of meringue. Beginning from the center, pipe 2 1/2-inch cones to cover the entire top of tier. Insert columns into the 12-inch tier; pipe 12, and 6-inch tiers in the same manner as in step 6. When ready to assemble the cake, dab a small amount of meringue onto the top of each column to fasten it to the above tier. Carefully stack the tiers.\nTwelve batches of batter are needed to yield 2 (6-inch) round layers, 2 (10-inch) layers, and 2 (14-inch) layers. Fill each 6-inch pan with 1 3/4 cups of batter. Fill each 10-inch pan with 5 cups of batter. Fill each 14-inch pan with 11 cups of batter. Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter baking pans; line bottom of each baking pan with a round of parchment paper. Butter parchment and dust pans with flour, making sure to coat pans evenly. Tap out excess flour. In the bowl of an electric mixture fitted with the paddle attachment, cream butter and sugar until light in color and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add vanilla extract, then the eggs, 1 at a time. Sift together flour, salt, and baking powder 3 times. Add to egg mixture in 3 additions, alternating with milk, starting and ending with flour. Measure batter into prepared pans. Bake 6-inch rounds for about 35 minutes, 10-inch rounds for about 45 minutes, and the 14-inch round for about 1 hour and 10 minutes. Cakes are done when the tops are golden brown and a cake tester inserted into center of cake comes out clean. Yield: 3 cups batter\nIn the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine confectioners' sugar, meringue powder, and egg white. Mixing on low speed, add 1/4 cup water. Mix until icing begins to come up the side of the bowl, about 5 minutes. Add an additional tablespoon water, and mix until icing holds a ribbon-like trail on the surface for 5 seconds when you raise the paddle. If more water is necessary, add more, drop by drop, until the proper consistency is achieved. Yield: 2 cups\nIn a large heavy saucepan, bring 4 cups of water and the sugar to a rolling boil. Remove from heat, and add lemon juice. Let stand at room temperature to cool. Set aside. (Can be made several days in advance.) Yield: 7 cups\nIn a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan, whisk together egg yolks and whole eggs. Add sugar and lemon juice. Set over low heat, and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture coats the back of a wooden spoon, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove pan from heat, and stir to cool slightly. Strain curd through a sieve set over a small bowl. Add butter, a piece at time, stirring until smooth after each addition. Stir in lemon zest, and let cool completely. Yield: 1 1/2 cups\nIn a small saucepan, bring sugar and 2/3 cup water to a boil. Boil until the syrup reaches the soft-ball stage (238 degrees on a candy thermometer). Meanwhile, in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat egg whites on low speed until foamy. Add cream of tartar; beat on medium high until stiff but not dry. With the mixer running, slowly pour the hot sugar syrup into egg whites, and beat on high speed until mixture has cooled, about 15 minutes. Use immediately. If the meringue is overbeaten or is not used immediately, it will contain too many air bubbles that will make holes when piped.

Keep chilled until ready to use.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F.\nDrain the cherry juices into a medium saucepan; you should have about a cup of juice. Add the cornstarch, sugar, ginger, and lemon juice and whisk to dissolve the cornstarch then bring it to a simmer over medium heat whisking all the while. When thickened, turn off the heat, stir in the cherries.\nPour the cherry filling into the ovenproof dishes and set aside to cool slightly. Carefully place the rolled-out disks on top and ease them into the dishes so it doesn't hang over the edge. Brush each disk with a little heavy cream and then sprinkle lightly with 2 tablespoons of sugar. With the tips of a pair of scissors, snip a X vent hole in the top of each crust.\nPlace the pies on a sheet pan, to catch any juices that boil over. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the juices are bubbling at the vents, 25 to 30 minutes.\nLet cool to room temperature. Serve at room temperature with vanilla ice cream.\nIn a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), mix the flour, salt, and sugar for 1 minute. Add the butter and mix just until you have a crumbly, sandy mixture. You should still be able to see the pieces of butter.\nIn a small bowl, stir the water and vinegar together. With the mixer running at medium speed, drizzle in the water-vinegar mixture and mix just until a dough forms. You should still see small bits of butter.\nTurn out onto a work surface, divide the dough in half, and shape into round, flat disks. Wrap separately in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before using. (Or, refrigerate up to 48 hours or freeze up to 1 month before using. If frozen, let thaw in the refrigerator overnight before rolling out.)\nWhen the time comes to roll out the dough, let the dough warm up for a few minutes at room temperature. Dust a work surface with just a few tablespoons of flour and keep some extra flour at hand. If you like, you can roll out the dough between two sheets of waxed paper (flouring the bottom sheet and the top of the dough before rolling), which makes it much easier to transfer to the pan later on. However, you won't be able to check the progress of the dough as easily. It's entirely up to you.\nSprinkle a little flour on top of the dough and start rolling outward from the center with quick, light strokes. Don't worry if the edges split a bit; concentrate on getting a good circle going from the center. Lift up and rotate the dough 1/4 turn every minute or so to help ensure even rolling. The dough should feel smooth and soft; some say it should feel like the inside of your forearm. If it gets sticky, sprinkle on a bit more flour, but don't do this more than two or three times; the dough will absorb too much flour. Instead, put it back in the fridge for 15 minutes to firm the butter up. Keep rolling until the circle is at least 2 inches larger than your pan (for example, 11 inches wide for a 9-inch pie pan), or 3 inches larger for deep-dish pies.\nSet your pie or tart pan nearby. We always use heavy aluminum pans, because glass pans seem to bake the crust too fast. However, we know that the advantage of glass is that you can easily check the color of the crust. Again, it's up to you. Either choice will work.\nTo transfer the crust to the pan, we find it easiest to roll a finished crust up onto the rolling pin, then gently unroll it in the pan. Or, you can fold it gently in quarters, lift it up, position the center point on the center of the pan, and unfold it into the pan. If using waxed paper, peel off the top layer, turn the crust gently into the pan, and peel off the remaining paper. Make sure that the dough is allowed to settle completely into the pan.\nDon't stretch and press the dough into the corners; stretched dough will likely shrink back when you bake it. Instead, lift the edges of the crust to let it settle down into the corners. If the dough tears a bit, don't be concerned; it will patch easily. Using scissors or a sharp knife, trim the dough to within 3/4 inch of the rim. Use any extra scraps to patch the crust, pressing with your fingers (wet them if necessary) or set aside.\nFor a double-crust pie: Leave the edges of the bottom crust hanging over the rim. Roll out the second piece of dough into a circle about 11 inches in diameter. Line a sheet pan with parchment or waxed paper. Roll the dough up onto the rolling pin, then unroll it onto the sheet pan.\nChill the finished crust or crusts for 20 to 30 minutes before filling the pie. When the bottom crust is filled, rest the top crust on top and pinch the edges together, turning them under all the way around. To decorate the rim, just press it all around with the back of a fork. For a slightly more advanced look, press the thumb and forefinger of one hand together. Use them to gently push the thick dough rim outward, while pushing inward with the forefinger of the other hand, so that they intersect in a \"V\" with the dough in between. Repeat all around the rim to make a wavy edge.\nFor a prebaked pie or tart crust (blind baking): Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line the inside of the chilled crust with aluminum foil (don't turn it down over the rim, but leave the extra sticking up so that you have something to hold on to). Fill the foil all the way up to the top of the shell with pie weights or dried beans. Bake 25 to 30 minutes, until dry and beginning to turn \"blond\". Lift the foil and weights out of the shell and bake another 10 to 15 minutes, checking frequently to prevent over baking, until medium brown.\nYield: 2 crusts Preparation time: 15 minutes plus rolling and shaping Cooking time: 30 minutes Ease of preparation: moderate\nRecipe courtesy Gale Gand, \"Butter Sugar Flour Eggs\" by Gale Gand, Rick Tramonto, Julia Moskin: Clarkson N.

Roll up the pork butt and sausage into a cylinder and truss with butcher's twine.\nHeat a large skillet over high heat until smoking hot. Add the grapeseed oil and then carefully place the porchetta roll in the pan fat-side down. Sear the porchetta on all sides until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side.

Combine the meat with the ricotta and Parmesan and season with salt and pepper. Whisk the eggs in a small bowl and hold for sealing the ravioli.\nFor making the ravioli with a ravioli mold: Cut the Pasta Dough sheets to the size of the molds. Lay one sheet over the mold. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of filling per indent, depending on size of the molds. Brush the dough not covered by the filling with the egg wash and then lay another piece of pasta over the top. Roll a rolling pin over the top of the mold to seal and cut the ravioli. You should have about 48 ravioli total.\nFor making the ravioli by hand without a ravioli mold: Cut the Pasta Dough sheets into 3-inch squares. Dollop 1 to 2 tablespoons of filling just off the center of each square toward one of the corners, brush the perimeter of the dough with the egg wash, fold the sheet over the filling, corner to corner, and seal by pressing around the filling with your fingers. You should have about 48 ravioli total.\nFor serving: Bring the Pasta Sauce to a simmer in a saucepan. Whisk in the butter. Bring 1 gallon water and 2 tablespoons kosher salt to a rapid boil in a large pot. Drop the ravioli in the water and cook until al dente, 2 to 3 minutes.

This is a skill that professional pastry chefs develop after years of experience. Working with sugar will burn your fingers so know before you start that your fingers will develop burn blisters. Place the sugar, vinegar and water in a saucepan over high heat. Insert a candy thermometer and cook until the sugar reaches 320 degrees F. Use a pastry brush to keep the inside of the saucepan clean as the sugar cooks or the sugar may recrystallize. To do this, dip a clean brush in cold water and brush the inside of the pan clean. Pour the cooked sugar onto 3 or 4 silicone baking mats. If you want to color and/or flavor the sugar with food colors and/or flavored oils, this is the time to do so. Add a few drops of color to the sugar. Mix with a wooden skewer. To get started, push the sugar from the sides toward the center. This process takes a little while. Try to keep the sugar divided by color. Use the mat to push the firm sugar around the edges toward the center. Use a folding motion to accomplish that task. The next step is to pick up the sugar with your hands. Place each color under the heat of the sugar lamp. Pull the sugar until it becomes glossy and the color is evenly distributed. You will need to pull the colors simultaneously. Keep them under the sugar lamp but keep an eye on them. The lamp can melt the sugar so it is important keep rotating it and folding it onto itself.\nStart with 2 pieces of colored sugar. I used red and green. Pull them into a rectangular shape that is about 1 1/2-inches wide by 3-inches long and 1/2-inch thick. Place the pieces side-to-side and let them stick together on the long side. Place a piece of white sugar that is about 1/2-inch wide by 3-inches long and 1/2-inch thick in the middle. Close the red and green around it. Roll it and twist it while pulling it. When it gets to the desired thickness, use a scissor to cut the length and shape into a cane. Allow to cool completely. The white is inside and will become apparent when eaten.\nJacques? tips: Vinegar keeps the sugar from crystallizing. You will not taste the flavor. It serves as an acid in this recipe. Sometimes candy cane recipes contain corn syrup, which makes the sugar very dry and very hot. Adding corn syrup makes it more difficult to work with the sugar at home. Remember, the sugar is at 320 degrees F, and that will burn you. The ideal work surface is a silpat placed over cool marble or granite. If you do not have marble or stone, use wood. It is a good idea to use gloves to help protect your hands from the heat and to prevent burning.\nI use a special sugar box that includes a special heat source, If you don?t have one, you can work in front of the oven. Set the oven to 300 degrees F. Open the oven door and place the silpat on the oven door. It provides a similar effect to the sugar box heater.", "ingredients": ["Scant 5 cups sugar (1 kilo)", "3 tablespoons vinegar (40 grams)", "1 cup plus 2 tablespoons water (250 grams)", "Essential oils ? assorted flavors", "Food color paste ? assorted colors"], "title": "Candy Canes", "picture_link": null}, "30485": {"instructions": "Combine the butter, sugar and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or in a large bowl if using a handheld electric mixer).

Divide the stuffing among the remaining 8 calamari bodies and secure closed with toothpicks.\nFor the sauce: Coat a large, wide skillet or saucepan with olive oil and add the onions and crushed red pepper. Season with salt and put the skillet over medium heat. Saute the onions until they are soft and aromatic, 7 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, another 2 minutes. Stir in the wine and cook until the wine has reduced by half. Pass the tomatoes through a food mill or puree them in a food processor and add them with 1 cup of water to the skillet. Season with salt, to taste, and simmer the sauce for 15 minutes.\nAdd the calamari to the skillet and cook for 20 to 25 minutes, turning them over halfway through the cooking time. Remove the calamari from the skillet and remove the toothpicks. Reduce the sauce to thicken, if needed.
