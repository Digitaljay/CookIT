Tap the bowl on the counter to settle the chocolate into the cream, then let sit for 1 minute. Using a rubber spatula, stir slowly in a circular motion, starting from the center of the bowl and working out to the sides. Be careful not to add too much air to the ganache. Stir until the chocolate is completely melted, about 2 minutes.\nAdd the liqueur and stir to combine. Allow the ganache to cool at room temperature until it is firm. This should take at least 4 hours in a 65 degree F room or 2 hours in the refrigerator.\nOnce the ganache is firm, it can be formed into truffle balls. Using a piping bag, a mini ice cream scoop, or a tablespoon, make 1 inch diameter blobs. Then roll the blobs into somewhat uniform balls by hand. This is messy, no doubt about it. If they begin to warm up and become soft, refrigerate for 10 to 15 minutes. If you have hot hands or it is a hot day, it may feel as though you can't get a grip on the truffle. Work near a sink with cold running water. When the ganache feels like it's melting, cool your hands under the running water then dry them and dust with a little cocoa powder. Be careful not to get too much cocoa powder on the truffles, or they will taste like cocoa powder.\nAfter the truffles are rolled, they can be finished in a variety of ways. The original cocoa powder is the easiest, and quite good.\nLine a baking sheet with parchment paper.\nUsing a serrated knife, finely chop the chocolate into 1/4-inch pieces and place in a medium heatproof bowl. Fill a medium saucepan half full of water, bring it to a simmer, and then turn off the heat. Create a double boiler by placing the bowl on top of the saucepan. Stir the chocolate occasionally with a rubber spatula until it melts, about 2 minutes.\nWhen the chocolate has melted, take it off the heat. Stir it slowly with a rubber spatula until the temperature drops to 90 degrees F, about 5 minutes. Place the remaining cocoa powder in a small bowl.\nDrop 1 rolled ganache ball in the melted chocolate. Remove it with a fork, tap off the excess chocolate, and toss it into the cocoa powder. Roll the truffle around in the cocoa until it is well coated. Transfer the truffle to the prepared baking sheet and let it harden. Repeat with each truffle, coating 1 at a time.\nCan deep, dark, intense, rich, velvety smooth chocolate be a spiritual experience? It certainly is heavenly when mixed with cream. Praise the pastry angels and pass the bonbons!\nThis is the basic ganache recipe. Use it for truffles, tarts, fillings, you name it. Follow the same technique when adjusting the recipe for firm and soft ganache. An alternative food processor method is given, which can be applied to any ganache recipe in this chapter.\nMy desire is not only to introduce you to ganache but also to make it a staple in your refrigerator. As long as you don't eat it all as a midnight snack, it can be available to help you throw together dessert at a moment's notice.\n8 ounces bittersweet chocolate\n1 cup heavy cream\nUsing a serrated knife, finely chop the chocolate into 1/4-inch pieces. Don't be lazy here. Big chunks will not melt.\nTraditional method: Place the chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl. Bring the cream to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Boiling means the cream will actually rise up in the pan and threaten to boil over.\nImmediately pour the boiling cream over the chopped chocolate. Tap the bowl on the counter to settle the chocolate into the cream, then let it sit for 1 minute. Using a rubber spatula, slowly stir in a circular motion, starting from the center of the bowl, and working out to the sides. Be careful not to add too much air to the ganache. Stir until all the chocolate is melted, about 2 minutes. It may look done after 1 minute of stirring, but keep going to be sure it's emulsified.\nFood processor method: Place the chopped chocolate in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Bring the cream to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat (or bring to a boil in the microwave.)\nImmediately pour the hot cream into the food processor, on top of the chocolate. Let sit for 1 minute, then pulse the machine 3 times. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula and pulse 3 more times, until all the chocolate is melted. This smooth, silky chocolate is now ganache. Transfer the ganache to a bowl.\nLet the ganache sit at room temperature until it cools to 70 degrees F. In a 65 degree F room, this will take approximately 4 hours or 2 hours in the refrigerator. You can speed up the process by pouring the ganache out onto a clean baking sheet (thinner layers cool faster.) Once the ganache reaches 70 degrees F, it is ready to be used. At this point it can be covered and stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.\nYield: 2 cups\nPrep Time: 5 minutes\nCook Time: 10 minutes\nInactive Prep Time: 2 to 4 hours\nEase of preparation: Easy", "ingredients": ["1 recipe Master Ganache, recipe follows, with the addition of:", "2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) unsalted butter, softened", "1 tablespoon light corn syrup", "2 tablespoons liqueur, such as Grand Marnier, kirsch, bourbon, or rum", "2 cups sifted unsweetened cocoa powder", "8 ounces bittersweet chocolate"], "title": "Truffles", "picture_link": "C7adFZZg/ERBrUX7essSVAJhuWnYcDS"}, "51315": {"instructions": "Heat the oil in a large deep heavy bottomed pan over medium heat to 375 degrees F.\nPeel potatoes and, using a mandoline, carefully cut into 1/8-inch thick julienne-style potatoes.

Spoon the topping mixture evenly over the filling, then cover with the lid. Place the skillet adjacent to the hot coals in a place where it will get a good amount of radiant heat so the topping cooks through evenly without burning. Use a metal shovel to pile hot coals on top of the lid (this will distribute heat from the top). Cook 45 to 50 minutes, rotating the skillet 90 degrees every 10 minutes so the cobbler cooks evenly. (Feed the fire with more wood as needed.) Change out the hot coals on top 2 or 3 times during cooking so the top stays hot throughout. When the cobbler is done, the fruit will be bubbling around the edges and the topping will be light and fluffy.

Set aside. Bring the water, sugar, lemon juice, and vanilla bean pulp to a boil in a medium saucepan or the microwave. Remove the syrup from the heat and pour it over the pears. Press a piece of waxed paper against the pears and, if the paper alone isn't enough to submerge the pears in the syrup, place a plate on top of the waxed paper. Cover the syrup with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. (The pears can be made up to 3 days ahead and kept covered in the refrigerator.) Cut the figs into small cubes (about 1/4-inch) and put them in a small saucepan. Cover with water and bring the water just to the boil. Transfer the figs and water to a container, cover, and refrigerate overnight. Make the ladyfingers, according to recipe below; bake, cool, and reserve. (The ladyfinger disks and bands can be made ahead, wrapped airtight, and kept at room temperature for 2 days or frozen for a month.) To assemble the charlotte: Remove and drain 3 of the pears, pat them dry between paper towels, and cut them into cubes, about 1/2-inch. Drain and pat dry the cubed figs. Mix the fruits together. Place a piece of parchment paper on a cardboard cake round and center an 8 3/4-inch/22-cm dessert ring on it; butter the inside of the ring. Cut the bands of ladyfingers in half lengthwise and fit the halves around the interior of the ring, making certain that the biscuits' flat side faces in; you will have a piece of band left over. Fit a ladyfinger disk into the bottom to form a base. (If you are using store-bought ladyfingers, cut the biscuits as necessary to form a band and base.) Brush the ladyfinger disk and band with the soaking syrup, using enough syrup to thoroughly moisten the cake. Spoon enough filling into the biscuit-lined ring to form a layer that comes about halfway up the ladyfinger band, and spread it evenly with a spatula. Cover with the cubed fruit and then cover the fruit with another layer of filling, this time coming almost to the top of the ring, and again using the spatula to get an even layer. Top this with the second ladyfinger disk and moisten this layer with some syrup. (You may have syrup left over). Cover the disk with a thin layer of filling (you may have filling left over; it makes a fine dessert on its own or served with cookies) and set the cake into the refrigerator to chill for 2 hours. (The cake can be made to this point and, when chilled, covered airtight and frozen for up to 2 weeks.) Remove the dessert ring, but keep the cake on the cardboard round for maneuverability. Slice the remaining pears from the blossom to stem end, and arrange the slices in overlapping concentric circles over the top of the cake. If fresh figs are available, slice them from blossom to stem end and slip them into the arrangement. If not, a purely pear topping is just fine. Serve the cake now or keep it in the refrigerator, loosely covered, until ready to serve.\nPrepare the batter: In an impeccably clean, dry mixer bowl with a clean, dry whisk attachment in place, whip the egg whites on high speed until they turn opaque and form soft peaks. Still whipping on high, gradually add 2/3 cup of the sugar. Continue beating until the whites are glossy and hold very firm peaks. It's important that the whites develop into a really firm meringue; this is what will allow the batter to rest on the counter for 15 minutes and still maintain its shape. Set aside for the moment. In another bowl, whisk the yolks and the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar together until they are well blended, about 1 to 2 minutes. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the yolk mixture into the beaten whites. Then fold in the flour, sifting the flour over the mixture in a few additions and incorporating it gingerly. (No matter how delicately you fold in the flour, the batter will deflate. Don't worry, but do be gentle.) The batter is now ready to be piped and baked. To pipe and bake: Position the racks to divide the oven into thirds and preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Fit a large pastry bag with a plain 1/2-inch tip and set aside until needed. Cut 2 pieces of parchment paper to fit 2 large baking sheets. On each sheet of paper, draw a 9-inch circle and, across 1 of the ends of the sheet, draw a band that is 8 inches long and 4 inches wide. Turn the sheets of paper over and place each piece of parchment on a baking sheet. (If you can't see the outlines clearly now that the paper is flipped over, darken the pencil lines.) Gently spoon a little more than half the batter into the pastry bag. Position a baking sheet so that the top and bottom lines for the 8-inch long band run from your left to your right. Start making a ladyfinger band by piping plump logs of batter from top to bottom within the pencil lines. Pipe 1 ladyfinger log right next to the last one so that they touch (they are supposed to). Keeping firm and steady pressure on the pastry bag, you should end up with ladyfingers that are about 1-inch wide and about 2/3 to 3/4-inch high. When you've piped the full 8-inch band, dust it lightly with confectioners' sugar and pipe the second band in the same fashion; dust it with confectioners' sugar too. Refill the bag when you run out of batter. (The bands will probably take about 2/3 of the batter.) Next, pipe the disks, keeping in mind that the disks should be only about half as high as the plump ladyfinger bands, so you can exert less pressure on the pastry bag. For each disk, begin piping the batter at the center of the circle. Work your way in a spiral to the penciled edge and try to have each coil of batter touch the preceding coil. If you have any holes, you can run an offset spatula very lightly over the disks to fill in the spaces. Let the piped batter rest on the counter for 15 minutes, during which time the confectioners' sugar will pearl or form beads. Give the bands a second light dusting of confectioners' sugar (there is no need to sugar the disks) and slip the baking sheets into the oven. Insert the handle of a wooden spoon into the oven to keep the door slightly ajar. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, just until the disks and bands are very lightly golden; you don't want the cake to take on much color. Slide the parchment off the baking sheets and transfer the cakes, on their parchment sheets, to racks. Allow the cakes to cool to room temperature. When the cakes are cool, run an offset spatula under the disks and bands to loosen them from the paper. If you want individual biscuits, separate the cookies with a sharp knife or pizza cutter. If you want a decorative ladyfinger band that can be wrapped around cakes or charlottes, keep the cookies intact but cut the band in half lengthwise, or according to the measurements given in the specific recipe. Yield: enough for 1 charlotte\nBring the water and sugar to a boil in a small saucepan or the microwave. Remove from heat and, when the syrup is cool, stir in the Poire William. (The syrup can be made up to a week ahead and kept in an airtight container in the refrigerator.) Yield: enough for 1 charlotte\nDrain the pears and then puree them in a blender or food processor; set aside. Fill a large bowl with ice cubes and have ready a smaller bowl and a fine-mesh strainer. Bring the milk to a boil in a small heavy saucepan. Meanwhile, whisk the sugar and yolks together in a heavy-bottomed 2-quart saucepan. Whisking without stopping, drizzle in about 1/3 of the boiling liquid. Once the yolks are acclimated to the heat, whisk in the rest of the milk in a slow, steady stream. Place the saucepan over medium heat and, stirring constantly with a wooden spatula or spoon, cook the cream until it reaches 180 degrees F, as measured on an instant-read thermometer (this will take less than 5 minutes). Alternatively, you can stir the cream, and then draw your finger down the spatula or the bowl of the wooden spoon, and if the cream doesn't run into the track you've created, it's done. The cream will not thicken much. Immediately remove the saucepan from the heat and allow the cream to rest for 2 minutes. Strain the creme anglaise into the small reserved bowl and stir in the Poire William. Sprinkle the gelatin over the water and allow it to rest until softened. Heat in the microwave oven for about 15 seconds, or cook over low heat, until the gelatin dissolves. Stir the gelatin into the creme anglaise and then gently stir in the reserved pureed pears. Set the bowl in the ice bath, adding cold water to the ice cubes, and, stirring from time to time, cool the creme anglaise to about 70 degrees F. To finish the filling, whip the heavy cream until it holds medium-firm peaks and fold it gently into the creme anglaise with a rubber spatula. The filling is now ready and should be used immediately.

Add the butter and mix just until you have a crumbly, sandy mixture. (You should still be able to see the pieces of butter.)\nIn a small bowl, stir the water and vinegar together.\nWith the mixer running at medium speed, drizzle in the water-vinegar mixture and mix just until a dough forms. (You should still see small bits of butter.) Transfer the dough to a work surface and shape into a round, flat disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before using. (Or, refrigerate up to 48 hours or freeze up to 1 month before using. If frozen, let thaw in the refrigerator overnight before rolling out.)\nWhen the time comes to roll out the dough, let the dough warm up for a few minutes at room temperature to make it more workable. Dust a work surface with just a few tablespoons of flour and keep some extra flour at hand. Sprinkle a little flour on top of the dough and start rolling outward from the center with quick, light strokes. Don't worry if the edges split a bit; concentrate on forming a good circle from the center. Lift up and rotate the dough 1/4 turn every minute or so to help ensure even rolling. The dough should feel smooth and soft; some say it should feel like the inside of your forearm. If it gets sticky, sprinkle on a bit more flour, but don't do this more than 2 or 3 times; the dough will absorb too much flour. Instead, put it back in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to firm up the butter. Keep rolling until the circle is at least 2 inches larger than your pan (for example, 12 inches wide for a 10-inch pie pan), or 3 inches larger for deep-dish pies.\nSet your pie pan nearby. We always use heavy aluminum pans, because glass pans seem to bake the crust too fast. However, we know that the advantage of glass is that you can easily check the color of the crust. To transfer the crust to the pan, I find it easiest to roll a finished crust up onto the rolling pin, then gently unroll it in the pan. Or, you can fold it gently in quarters, lift it up, position the center point on the center of the pan, and unfold it into the pan. Make sure that the dough is allowed to settle completely into the pan.\nDon't stretch and press the dough into the corners; stretched dough will likely shrink back when you bake it. Instead, lift the edges of the crust to let it settle down into the corners. If the dough tears a bit, don't be concerned; we'll patch it in a minute. Using scissors or a sharp knife, trim the dough to within 3/4-inch of the rim. Use any extra scraps to patch the crust, pressing with your fingers (wet them if necessary) or set aside. To decorate the rim, fold under the excess dough then just press it all around with the back of a fork. For a slightly more advanced look, press the thumb and forefinger of one hand together. Use them to gently push the thick dough rim outward, while pushing inward with the forefinger of the other hand, so that they intersect in a \"V\" with the dough in between. Repeat all around the rim to make a wavy edge. Chill it while you prep the filling.\nMake the Filling: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.\nIn a medium bowl, toss the sugar, salt, cornstarch, cinnamon, and nutmeg together. Sprinkle half the sugar mixture on the bottom of the pie shell.\nUsing a Japanese-style turning vegetable slicer, cut the apples into 1-inch wide, long strips. Make apple strips into S-curves (like ribbon candy) and tuck them into the crust next to each other tightly to fill the pie shell. Sprinkle the remaining sugar mixture over the ribbons and dot with the butter.\nPlace the pie on a sheet pan to catch any juices that boil over. Bake in the center of the oven for 10 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375 degrees F. and bake until the crust is golden brown about 40 to 50 minutes more.

If not using Salt Lick BBQ sauce, make sure your sauce has no tomatoes in it, as they will burn and leave a bitter taste. When turning the brisket, try not to use a barbecue fork. If you do, only insert it at the edges.
