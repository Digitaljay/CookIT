Don't cut the bag until you're ready to use the royal icing and don't overfill the bag--you want enough room to tie the back of the bag off to keep the icing airtight. If any air comes into contact with the icing, it gets hard and that part of the icing is useless. Never attempt to mix hard bits back into the royal icing--you'll ruin the whole batch. The other accepted method of storing the icing is to scrape it into a plastic or ceramic bowl, and cover it with a wet paper towel. This method works, but it wastes both paper towels and royal icing. It's also just annoying. When you're piping small designs, you want to use very small parchment piping bags. It's easy to stick the nose of a large piping bag into a small one and extract exactly how much you need. When the icing is in a bowl, you have to use a spoon to get it out.

Cut the bread lengthwise into quarters. Grill or broil the bread, watching carefully and turning as each side browns and chars slightly; total time will be less than 10 minutes.\nWhile the bread cools, mix together the next five ingredients in a large bowl. Mash the tomatoes with the back of a fork to release all of their juices. Season to taste with salt and pepper to taste. Cut the bread into 1/2- to 1-inch cubes (no larger) and toss it with the dressing.\nLet the bread sit for 20 to 30 minutes, tossing occasionally and tasting a piece every now and then. The salad is at its peak when the bread is fairly soft but some edges remain crisp, but you can serve it before or after it reaches that state. When it's ready, stir in the herb and serve.\nWith MINIMAL Effort:\nBread salad is a way of making good use of stale bread. The bread is softened, usually with water, olive oil, lemon juice, or a combination, then tossed with tomatoes and a variety of seasonings. Like many old-fashioned preparations created as a way to salvage food before it goes bad (count pickles and jam among these), bread salad has an appeal of its own. This is especially true in the summer, when good tomatoes are plentiful and may lead to the rather unusual problem of waiting around for bread to become stale.\nOr, of course, making it stale. I'd always solved this problem by drying bread in the oven until I realized that using the grill or broiler would not only dry the bread more quickly but, by charring the edges slightly, add another dimension of flavor to the salad. This procedure is really the same as making toast--exposing the bread to direct heat (rather than the indirect heat of the oven) to brown it as well as dry it. There's another benefit to grilling the bread in order to dry it out: The added flavor makes it possible to strip the salad to its bare minimum.\nThis is a substantial salad, but it's still a side dish unless you're in the mood for a very light meal. Because it's juicy, almost saucy, and pleasantly acidic, this salad makes a nice accompaniment to simple grilled meat or poultry, and has a special affinity for dark fish such as tuna and swordfish.\nThe only tricks here involve timing. You must watch the bread carefully as you grill or broil it; a slight char is good, but it's a short step from there to burned bread. And the time you allow the bread to soften after tossing it with the seasonings varies some; keep tasting until the texture pleases you. If your tomatoes are on the dry side, you might add a little extra liquid, in the form of more olive oil and lemon juice, or a light sprinkling of water.", "ingredients": ["1 small baguette (about 8 ounces) or other crusty bread", "1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil", "1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (good vinegar also works well)", "2 tablespoons diced shallot, scallion, or red onion", "1/4 teaspoon minced garlic, optional", "1 1/2 pounds tomatoes, chopped", "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "1/4 cup or more roughly chopped basil or parsley"], "title": "Grilled Bread Salad", "picture_link": null}, "8021": {"instructions": "Combine white cranberry juice and orange juice.

Cut the peeled shrimp into chunks that approximately match the size of the scallop wedges (unless you have rock shrimp, which doesn't need to be cut). In a medium bowl, pour enough lime juice over the scallop and shrimp pieces to cover. Toss gently so each piece is given a good lime juice bath. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place the bowl in the refrigerator to marinate for 4 to 10 hours. The shellfish is done when it's completely white and opaque and doesn't look or taste raw.\nIn a separate bowl, mix the remaining lime juice with the lemon juice, coconut milk, and olive oil. You can chop the jalapeno, cilantro, and garlic by hand, but if you have a food processor it's much easier to pulse the 3 together. Add the pepper mixture to the coconut mixture, and stir in the red onion. (You may add the mango chunks here if you like, but I prefer to add them right before serving.)
