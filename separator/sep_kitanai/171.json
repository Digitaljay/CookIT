This recipe will give approximate measures and ideas but this is not an exact recipe for the exact centerpiece I made. You can make molds or templates. If you make molds, use the Elastack material to create a mold for virtually any shape of an item made from virtually any relatively heat-proof material. For templates, draw the design onto poster board or foam board and use an X-acto knife to cut the design from the board. Make the molds: Place the Elastack molding material in a saucepan over medium heat until melted. Use metal rulers to outline the mold that you would like to make. For my centerpiece, I used some bicycle gears with sprockets I bought at a bicycle repair store. The pieces ranged in diameter from 2 to 17 inches and I chose them for their unique shapes. Place the rulers on a parchment paper lined sheet pan, and place the item(s) to be molded in the center of that space. Pour the melted Elastack over the item to be molded until it is completely covered. Let this set for about 30 minutes until the Elastack hardens. When set, remove the original piece. Now the mold is ready to use.\nI made templates for a 30-inch tall, gear inspired support piece, a 16-inch gear with sprocket, the flying machine wings, back reinforcement and spine, and other gears. If using templates, use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered dark chocolate over a sheet of parchment paper. If the piece you will cut out is very tall, make a thicker layer so the chocolate will support the height. Remember, dark chocolate is stronger than white chocolate. It is also easier to work with a thicker layer if you use rulers to outline the overall perimeter of the space. Let the chocolate set slightly. Place the template on top of the chocolate and use a paring knife to trace around it. I used a pastry tip to cut half-circles from the edge of the chocolate support piece to make the sprockets (the notched part) of the gear. Use a larger round cutter on the larger gear piece to cut sprockets around the outside perimeter. Make these cuts before the chocolate sets. When the chocolate is set, peel off the parchment and save the excess chocolate for a future use. Use a paper cornet filled with white chocolate to fill the small gears in the Elastack mold. Use the same technique to fill the other gears using dark or white chocolate, as you are inspired. Unmold the gears when the chocolate has set.\nMake the rivet heads: Place tempered dark chocolate in a pastry bag and pipe chocolate into a flexible mini-dome mold pan. Fill the domes half full. When the chocolate sets, unmold. If you want to add the additional detail of the head of a screw, use the back of a hot knife to score the center of the dome. Make a base: Use flexible aluminum strips or very large cake ring to form a base. The base I made was 16 inches in diameter. Place it on a parchment paper lined surface. Pour tempered dark chocolate inside the ring to form a 1/2-inch-thick layer. When the chocolate has set, remove the ring and peel off the parchment paper. I painted the gears with luster dust and cocoa butter. If you use an airbrush, simply place a few drops of color in the receptacle of the airbrush and decorate, as you are inspired. Remember, luster dust comes in a large array of colors and metals so have fun with this! Make a transfer sheet: If you would like to recreate a painting or image from a book, tape the original image to the work surface. Place a piece of acetate over the image. Mix together a few tablespoons of the cocoa butter with a small amount of powdered food color and trace the image with a paintbrush. It will be easier if you use a yogurt machine to store and warm your paints. Use an airbrush to \"antique\" the painting. If you use an airbrush, simply place a few drops of color in the receptacle of the airbrush and paint, as you are inspired. When the paint had dried, use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of tempered white chocolate over the acetate design. When the chocolate begins to set, use a sharp paring knife to trim the outside edge of the painting. When the chocolate sets, peel away the acetate and the image will be on the chocolate. You can use this technique to recreate any image. The results will be as good as your painting skills!\nModeling chocolate is a great medium to use to create any number of things. I used it to make the support of Leonardo's flying machine. I rolled a piece that was about 3/8-inch in diameter and about 3 inches long. Using tempered chocolate as glue, I positioned the wings on either side of the spine and glued them together. The reinforcement support was glued to 1 side. I inverted this whole piece and glued the modeling chocolate spine to the center. To make white chocolate decorations: Fill a paper cornet with tempered white chocolate. Use a scissor to trim the tip to a fine point. Use the chocolate to draw any design on the wings of the flying machine. Assemble: Use a sharp knife to scar the base of the chocolate where the support will be attached. Using tempered dark chocolate as glue, attach the center support. Glue the gears onto the tall support as you are inspired to do so. Continue with the rivets and more gears. Position the paintings and attach, if necessary. Add the flying machine. Use a pastry brush to gloss with vegetable oil, if desired.

(Of course, this does not make them edible!) You may need more than one coating. Place the coated branches on a sheet of parchment paper until the chocolate has fully set.\nFor the base of this presentation, use a small plastic container as a mold, the size of which depends upon the size of the branches you've coated in chocolate. Center the branches inside the container and add bittersweet chocolate, filling it to the top. Allow to harden. When the chocolate has set, remove the plastic container. Use bittersweet chocolate to \"glue\" whatever you've chosen to hang from the tree. There is no set pattern, just let your eye guide you as you randomly decorate the branches. Use as many or as few as you like, depending on the size of your tree. It will look more interesting if color is added (i.e. fresh fruits, orange peels, white chocolate leaves, etc). Use the chocolate tree as a centerpiece for the dining room table during dinner. When it is time for dessert, your guests can simply pick the petit fours and candies from the tree.\nAssorted items to hang from the \"tree\", for example: cookies, petit fours, fresh fruits such as cherries or raspberries, orange peels, white chocolate leaves, etc.\nHow to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres):\nChocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper.\nOne of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate's residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer.\nAnother way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk.\nThe classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess.\nA simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes.", "ingredients": ["Plain tree branches", "32 ounces bittersweet chocolate, tempered"], "title": "Chocolate Tree", "picture_link": "es0dPSykr4mb3ewSq1ZjY.vLpy4EA6a"}, "51176": {"instructions": "Watch how to make this recipe.\nIn a small pot, bring the vinegar, honey, salt, bay leaf and 1/2 cup water to a simmer.
