When the stock reaches a boil, add the rice and stir it a bit to prevent sticking. Let it come to a rolling boil and lower the heat a bit to medium. Stir the rice once in a while, you want the rice to absorb all of the liquid; it should take 15 to 20 minutes. Taste the rice; it should be slightly al dente but creamy.

Keep mixing with a wooden spoon until the meat is well done and browned. Add the white wine and stir until it is evaporated. Add the tomato puree and tomato paste in water. Bring to a boil, and then lower the heat to medium, stirring occasionally. There will be some fat that comes to the top. Skim it off with a ladle but you want to leave some for the flavor. Let cook for about 1 1/2 hours.\nAbout 5 minutes before the ragu is done, saute the peas in a touch of butter with a pinch of salt and add to the ragu. Put the ragu in a bowl and set aside to cool. You can leave it overnight covered in the fridge.\nFor the filling and assembly: Portion out cooled rice into identical portions. We weigh ours to 1.6 ounces. Take one portion and form it into a semi-circle in the palm of your hand, making a cup-like shape to place the ragu and mozzarella into. Scoop a generous amount of ragu, about 2 teaspoons, into the half ball and then a few cubes of mozzarella. Take another portion of rice and flatten it into a disk shape. Place that disk over the half ball to enclose the ragu and cheese in the center. Have a bowl of warm water nearby to dip your hands into' it'll make the process easier and less sticky. Roll the ball around to enclose all ingredients in the center and shape into a perfectly round ball. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.\nFor the batter and breading: Place the flour and 1 1/2 cups cold water into a bowl and add a pinch of salt. Mix with a whisk until smooth and about the consistency of eggnog. Add the breadcrumbs to a large bowl or baking dish. Roll each rice ball in the batter and shake off excess batter. Then roll each ball in the breadcrumbs. Repeat with all the balls.\nUse a heavy duty pot with enough canola oil to submerge the balls in. Make sure the oil isn't near the top of the pot because it will overflow when you drop your balls in. Bring the oil to 350 degrees F, using a high temp thermometer if you have one. If not you can throw a small piece of white bread in to test; it should brown quickly and float when the oil is hot enough.\nUse a slotted spoon or wire basket to lower your balls into the hot oil.

Line a second baking sheet or tray with wax paper and place next to your work surface.\nTo temper chocolate: Melt 3/4 of the chopped chocolate (24 ounces semisweet) with the shortening in the top of a double boiler over simmering water or a bowl that sits in a pan of very hot (but not simmering) water. Stir the chocolate constantly as it melts, being very careful not allow chocolate to overheat or to allow even one drop of water to enter bowl. When just about smooth (one or two small pieces of chocolate may remain visible), immediately remove the chocolate from the stove and briskly stir in the remaining chopped chocolate. Stir constantly until perfectly smooth.\nTo assemble chocolate crisps: When smooth, stir in cereal and, when well combined, use a large rubber spatula to help pour into prepared baking sheet. Use an offset metal spatula to spread chocolate mixture evenly in pan, then lift pan and give it one or two good rap's on the counter to remove any air bubbles and assure an even layer. Place in freezer (uncovered) for no longer than 5 minutes, then remove and, using sturdy cookie cutters (plain or flutted), cut chocolate into shapes. As you cut, gently push chocolates out of the cutter onto second sheet, lined with wax paper.\nNote: Since cutting cooled chocolate into shapes takes a little muscle, place a pot holder or a folded dry kitchen towel over top of cutter to protect your hand.\nTo wrap and store: If desired, wrap crisps individually in colored foil wrappers (available in stores that specialize in candy making). Alternatively, store unwrapped crisps in a tin, separated by sheets of wax paper. Tempered chocolate should be stored at a comfortable room temperature.\nShaping Variation\nTo form drop candies: After tempering chocolate, choose any type of addition: i.e. crispy cereal, cocktail peanuts, raisins, walnuts, minimarshmallows, mini m & m's, diced chewy caramels and the list goes on... After stirring in your chosen addition, drop mixture by heaping teaspoonfuls onto wax paper lined tray, with 1inch in between each mound. When finished, place tray in the freezer for 3 to 5 minutes (no longer). Remove and let sit at room temperature until completely set. Store in an airtight tin, separated by sheets of wax paper.\nChocolate Variation and Temperature Guide\nBeginners should stick to working with the darker chocolates (semisweet, bittersweet and dark sweet). The lighter chocolates (milk and white chocolate) are more heat sensitive because of the milk solids.\nIf you feel more confident using a chocolate thermometer, purchase a mercury thermometer specifically designed for chocolate. When melting the initial bulk of chocolate, don't allow the temperature to rise above 118F. At 115F, it's the right time to remove the bowl from heat and stir in remaining chopped chocolate. After stirring until smooth, check temperature. The darker chocolates should be cooled to 90F to be in proper condition after setting. Lighter chocolates should be cooled to 86F. Keep stirring briskly until desired temperature is reached, then chocolate is ready to work with as directed in your given recipe.", "ingredients": ["10 x 15 inch shallow baking sheet", "Sturdy cookie cutters with tight seams (not needed if making \"drop\" candies)", "32 ounces chocolate (I use a mixture of 24 ounces semisweet and 8 ounces pure milk chocolate)", "1 tablespoon solid vegetable shortening", "1 1/2 rounded cups \"crispy' cereal of your choice (preferably rice crispies- plain or cocoa flavored)"], "title": "Chocolate Crisps", "picture_link": null}, "5962": {"instructions": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
