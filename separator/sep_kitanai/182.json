Take the tip of the triangle on the short, wide end and roll it toward the other tip of that same end while simultaneously pulling it in an upward motion. The tip of a cone will form where your thumb and finger hold it on the long side.\nRelease your grip from the long side, so that you are now holding the 2 corners where they meet. The paper will already resemble a partially formed cone. Roll the remaining tail until it is completely rolled into a cone. There will be 1 point sticking up from the open end. Fold it inside toward the center, and crease the fold. Now you should have a cornet. To close the cornet once it has been filled, fold it away from the seam; this will keep the seam from opening.

Add food coloring, if desired, and transfer to a pastry bag to pipe onto cookies. ;\nTo Decorate:\nLine the backside of a sheet pan with aluminum foil. Place 4 inch wide strips of parchment paper around the border of the sheet pan to keep the foil clean while you decorate the cake. Place cake rounds side by side on the lined sheet tray. Slice one side off each cupcake. Place cupcakes side by side at one end of a cake round with the cut/flat side facing up (this will be the top of the top hat). Frost both cakes and cupcakes with frosting so that it looks like a hat is resting on a snowman's head resting on a body. Remove the parchment paper. Spread or drizzle the bottom third of the sheet pan with some royal icing (the royal icing will act as glue for the coconut). Sprinkle the coconut over the royal icing to mimic snow. Randomly place 20 dollops of royal icing around the rest of the sheet pan. Place the snowflake cookies on each dollop of royal icing. Decorate the snowman's hat with rows of blue mints, starting at the very top of the Snowman's head and working up onto the cupcakes. To decorate the face use the peppermint patties for eyes, place a small dot of the royal icing in the center of each patty and place a blue jellybean on top of the royal icing. Use the orange gum drop for the nose and the blue candy coated chocolates for the smile. To make the buttons dip the flat side of a hard candy into the royal icing and then into the colored decorating sugar and place on the snowman's chest; repeat with remaining 2 hard candies. Take 2 (8-inch) piece fruit strips and tie them into a knot. Drape fruit strips across where the 2 cake rounds meet to make a scarf. To make the \"broom\", take a 3-inch long piece of fruit strip and slice the bottom 2 inches into thin strips. Place a small amount of royal icing at the end of the over sized candy cane and place the unsliced end of the fruit strip on to the royal icing. Use the large white gumdrops to make the hands. Place the candy cane next too one of his hands. ;", "ingredients": ["1 (18.25-ounce) box white cake mix (recommended: Betty Crocker)", "1 1/3 cups water", "1/2 cup vegetable oil", "3 eggs", "1 teaspoon peppermint extract", "2 unfrosted cupcakes", "2 (12-ounce) containers whipped white frosting (recommended: Betty Crocker Fluffy White)", "2 large egg whites or 5 tablespoons meringue powder", "2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract", "3 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted", "Food coloring, if desired", "Royal icing (in a squeeze bottle or piping bag)", "2 cups sweetened flake coconut", "20 store bought small snowflake shaped cookies", "1 (7.5-ounce) bag square blue mint candies (for hat)", "2 peppermint patties (for eyes)", "2 blue jelly beans (for eyes)", "1 orange gumdrops (for nose)", "8 blue candy covered chocolates (for mouth)", "3 round hard candies (for buttons)", "1/4 cup color decorating sugar", "1 foot long fruit roll-up (for scarf) (recommended: Fruit by the Foot)", "1 giant blue peppermint stick (for broom stick)", "6 large white gum drops (for hands)"], "title": "Snowman Cake", "picture_link": "SACz9//BLe1y/eF5wztz7IDd6wKSV9a"}, "54408": {"instructions": "Fill a cocktail shaker or small pitcher with ice.

Add the almonds and stir to coat them evenly in the sugar syrup. Your goal is to cook the almonds until the sugar crystallizes and caramelizes.\nWhen water is added to the sugar, the sugar crystals are dissolved. As it boils, the syrup becomes thicker as the water evaporates and big soap-like bubbles begin to form. Soon, all the moisture evaporates and the mixture becomes sandy. The sandiness is the sugar recrystallizing. It only takes the reformation of one sugar crystal to recrystallize the others. Keep stirring! Next, you see the sugar closest to the heat change from sandy to a clear liquid. The melted sugar clings to the almonds. When the sugar changes from clear to golden brown, the nuts are caramelized. Once this happens, pay close attention; the time it takes to pass from caramelized to burned is only a matter of seconds, especially when making smaller batches. You know the nuts are finished when most of the sandy sugar is gone.\nThe first few times you make these, I suggest you try the following: When the sugar closest to the heat changes from sandy to liquid, remove the pan from the burner and continue to stir. The residual heat in the sugar and nuts will continue to cook the mixture while you stir it. Lower the heat to medium-low and continue to stir the nuts while moving the saucepan on and off the heat at 10-second intervals. This will give you more control as it cooks. When the nuts begin to caramelize, remove them from the heat and finish stirring.\nUse a wooden spoon to spread the caramelized nuts onto a parchment paper-covered baking sheet. Do not touch the nuts as they are extremely hot. Let the nuts cool completely. If your freezer will accommodate the baking sheet, you can place the nuts in the freezer for about 30 minutes to speed up the cooling process. When completely cooled, break apart any nut clusters that may have formed. At this stage, you can choose to serve the nuts as they are.\nPlace the caramelized nuts in the coating pan attached to the stand mixer. Spin at low speed.
