Set aside.\nIn another medium bowl, whisk the oil and eggs together quickly so that they combine thoroughly. They will be thick and satiny, and light in color. Whisk in the sour cream but leave some visible streaks of white, being careful not to over mix. Pour in the melted chocolate mixture and mix until just combined. Add the chocolate and sour cream mixture to the dry ingredients in the mixing bowl fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on medium speed adding in thirds until just combined, 1 to 2 minutes.\nRemove the bowl from the mixer and incorporate with a rubber spatula any ingredients that may be hiding at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be very wet and chocolaty, so it helps to transfer the batter into a liquid measuring cup to make it easier to pour.\nPour the batter into the prepared cupcake pan, filling each baking cup about two-thirds full. Refill the measuring cup as needed and repeat until all of the cupcake cups are filled. Bake the cupcakes until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Set aside to cool for at least 20 minutes. Once the cupcakes are cooled, remove them from the paper liners.\nFor the creamy coconut buttercream frosting: Combine the flour, 1/2 cup of the milk and vanilla extract in a small saucepan, and whisk until incorporated. Over medium heat, gradually add the remaining 1 1/2 cups milk and whisk constantly. Continue to cook the mixture until it comes to a low boil. Reduce the heat to low and continue to whisk until the mixture begins to thicken and starts to burp, 2 to 3 minutes.\nRemove the mixture from the heat and transfer it to a small heat-proof bowl to cool. Stir the mixture occasionally as it continues to cool to keep it lump free. If you do get few lumps, don't worry, you can whisk the mixture to dissolve the lumps, or pass the mixture through a mesh sieve to get a completely smooth consistency. Set the mixture aside to cool to room temperature.\nIn a stand mixer or with an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the butter on medium speed until it is soft and creamy, 2 to 3 minutes. Gradually add in the sugar and beat on high speed until light and fluffy, 5 to 7 minutes. Gradually add in the cooled milk mixture and increase the mixer to medium-high speed and whip until the frosting is light and fluffy, scraping down the bottom and sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula to make sure the frosting is thoroughly mixed. The frosting can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.\nTo assemble the cupcakes: Use an apple corer or a paring knife to scoop out a hole in the middle of the cupcake about 1 inch deep. (The extra cake is yours for the snacking.) Fill a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch pastry tip with the buttercream frosting and fill the hole of each cupcake with frosting. Frost the cupcakes all over with the frosting. Place the coconut in a small bowl. Roll the frosted cupcakes in the tinted coconut and decorate with Crystallized Flowers, if desired. Store the cupcakes in an airtight container for up to 2 days.\nDilute the meringue powder with 4 tablespoons warm water.\nPick some pesticide free, fresh. fully opened edible flowers such as Johnny-jump-ups, pansies, violets, marigolds and roses. Gently give the flowers a water bath in a small bowl of water with a pinch of salt. Next, dunk them in a bowl filled with ice cubes to perk the petals up. Gently remove the flowers and set aside to air dry on paper towels.\nWorking over a small bowl, apply a thin layer of the meringue powder mixture with the paint brush. Sprinkle the sugar over the flowers shaking off the excess. Use the tweezers to make sure the delicate flower is completely covered with sugar. Set aside to dry in a cool dry place for 2 to 4 hours. The flowers will take a bit longer to dry in humid weather.

This will ensure that the omelet cooks faster, and the faster an omelet cooks, the more tender it's going to be. Crack the eggs into a small bowl or large bowl-shaped coffee mug. Season with a pinch of fine salt. Beat the eggs gently with a fork.\nTIP: I prefer a fork to a whisk for omelets because I don't want to work air into the eggs: Air bubbles are insulators and can slow down cooking if you're not careful.\nHeat the pan: Heat a 10-inch nonstick saute pan over medium to high heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon room-temperature unsalted butter. Once melted, spread the butter around the pan with a basting brush to ensure coverage.\nTIP: Heat your pan empty for a few minutes before adding the butter: Even a nonstick surface is pocked with microscopic pores that eggs can fill and grab hold of. Heat expands the metal, squeezing these openings shut.\nAdd the eggs: Pour the eggs into the center of the pan and stir vigorously with a silicone spatula for 5 seconds. (Actually, it's not so much a matter of stirring with the spatula as holding the spatula relatively still and moving the pan around to stir the eggs.)\nLet them cook: As soon as curds begin to form (that's the stuff that looks like scrambled eggs), lift the pan and tilt it around until the excess liquid pours off the top of the curds and into the pan. Then use the spatula to shape the edge and make sure the omelet isn't sticking. Move the spatula around the edge of the egg mixture to help shape it into a round and loosen the edge. Then walk away. That's right-let that omelet sit unaccosted for 10 long seconds so it can develop a proper outer crust. Don't worry: Your patience will be rewarded.\nFinish the omelet: Time for the \"jiggle\" step: Simply shake the pan gently to make sure the omelet is indeed free of the pan. Lift up the far edge of the pan and snap it back toward you. Then use the spatula to fold over the one-third facing you.\nChange your grip on the pan handle from an overhand to an underhand and move to the plate, which you might want to lube with just a brief brushing of butter to make sure things don't bind up in transit. Slide the one-third farthest from you onto the plate and then ease the fold over. Imagine that you're making a tri-fold wallet out of eggs-because that's exactly what you're doing.
