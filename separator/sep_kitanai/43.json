Do this after any long drive by turning off the engine and letting the car sit for 15 minutes. Then lift up the hood and quickly tap the various components of the engine block. On most vehicles, the hottest area is the exhaust manifold cover, but most engines have additional nooks and crannies that will generate enough heat to slow-cook your freeway fare. Stay clear of areas near any moving parts such as the accelerator linkage, belts, or fans, and don't block any air intakes.\nThe sensible way (relatively speaking) to take advantage of the oven under your hood is to cook small portions of lightly textured foods. For this reason, fish is the perfect road chow. Before attempting any complex recipes, get to know your engine by cooking a hot dog (or tofu dog), the guinea pig of engine cooking.\nWhen you are ready to cook:\n\u00bf Lay out 3 equal-size sheets of aluminum foil, one on top of the other.\nProceed as if they were a single sheet.\n\u00bf Grease the top sheet with a small amount of butter or olive oil to avoid\nstickage.\n\u00bf Wrap ingredients in foil, then seal the seams by folding them over twice\nand tightly pinching them to create an airtight package. FYI, even\nperfectly sealed packages will leak small amounts of liquid.\nBefore placing food on the engine, loosely roll up a 6-inch ball of foil, set it on top of the engine, and close the hood. Immediately reopen the hood and use the squashed ball to determine the amount of clearance space between it and the engine block. Set food on the predetermined sweet spot of your engine and secure it with a ball of foil that is equal to the clearance space less the pouch size. If you are cooking on a slanted section of the engine, strap the pouch in place with additional aluminum foil bracing. If you are cooking in a nook or cranny, be sure that package is secure.\nMake, model, speed, outside temperature, food density, and placement will all affect the cooking time. Most small packets of food should cook in 1 to 2 hours. To ensure that you have fingers left to lick at the end of the meal, always turn off the engine before loading, unloading, or testing for doneness.", "ingredients": ["3 (12 by 16-inch) sheets aluminum foil", "1 tablespoon butter or olive oil", "2 (6-ounce) red snapper fillets, or other lightly textured fish", "2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice", "Salt and freshly ground pepper", "1 tablespoon fresh thyme, stems discarded", "1 cup olive oil", "1 cup fresh basil, stems discarded", "1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil", "1 1/2 tablespoons butter", "2 carrots, peeled and sliced into 1/4-inch slices", "2 potatoes, diced into 1/4-inch cubes", "1 yam, peeled and diced into 1/4-inch cubes", "6 asparagus spears, sliced into 1/4-inch pieces", "10 peeled cloves garlic", "2 large shallots, quartered", "2 tablespoons freshly chopped herbs (thyme, tarragon, rosemary. . . whatever), stemmed and minced", "Salt and pepper"], "title": "Six-Cylinder Snapper with Basil Oil and Succotash", "picture_link": null}, "12770": {"instructions": "Place an oven rack in the center of the oven.

Immediately turn off the heat and set aside.\nIn a large, heavy skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Stir in the brown sugar, raise the heat to medium-high, and cook 5 to 7 minutes, stirring constantly, to caramelize the mixture. (You will smell a characteristic nutty-caramel odor when the butter browns, signaling that the mixture is ready.)\nWhisking constantly, gradually add the butter/brown sugar mixture to the hot milk/cream mixture. If the mixture is not smooth, blend for 20 seconds with a hand blender or pour through a fine sieve.\nPut the egg yolks in a medium bowl. Whisk in about 1/2 cup of the hot milk mixture. Whisk in the cornstarch and salt until dissolved. Whisk the cornstarch mixture back into the hot milk mixture in the saucepan. Add the scotch and whisk in.\nWhisking constantly, cook over medium-high heat until thick and just boiling. When the mixture thickens, the whisk will leave trail marks on the bottom of the pot and the mixture will have a few large bubbles boiling up to the top.\nTurn off the heat and whisk in the vanilla extract. Pour into the pre-baked pie shell and chill, uncovered, at least 2 hours, or overnight.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F.\nFor the meringue top: Whip whites with the salt to soft peaks, then add sugar and whip until sugar is dissolved and whites are glossy. Spread meringue on top of the slightly cooled pie and bake for 5 minutes until lightly browned (cappuccino colored). Chill until ready to serve.\nIn a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), mix the flour, salt, and sugar for 1 minute. Add the butter and mix just until you have a crumbly, sandy mixture. You should still be able to see the pieces of butter.\nIn a small bowl, stir the water and vinegar together. With the mixer running at medium speed, drizzle in the water-vinegar mixture and mix just until a dough forms. You should still see small bits of butter.\nTurn out onto a work surface, divide the dough in half, and shape into round, flat disks. Wrap separately in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before using. (Or, refrigerate up to 48 hours or freeze up to 1 month before using. If frozen, let thaw in the refrigerator overnight before rolling out.)\nWhen the time comes to roll out the dough, let the dough warm up for a few minutes at room temperature. Dust a work surface with just a few tablespoons of flour and keep some extra flour at hand. If you like, you can roll out the dough between two sheets of waxed paper (flouring the bottom sheet and the top of the dough before rolling), which makes it much easier to transfer to the pan later on. However, you won't be able to check the progress of the dough as easily. It's entirely up to you.\nSprinkle a little flour on top of the dough and start rolling outward from the center with quick, light strokes. Don't worry if the edges split a bit; concentrate on getting a good circle going from the center. Lift up and rotate the dough 1/4 turn every minute or so to help ensure even rolling. The dough should feel smooth and soft; some say it should feel like the inside of your forearm. If it gets sticky, sprinkle on a bit more flour, but don't do this more than two or three times; the dough will absorb too much flour. Instead, put it back in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to firm the butter up. Keep rolling until the circle is at least 2 inches larger than your pan (for example, 11-inches wide for a 9-inch pie pan), or 3 inches larger for deep-dish pies.\nSet your pie or tart pan nearby. We always use heavy aluminum pans, because glass pans seem to bake the crust too fast. However, we know that the advantage of glass is that you can easily check the color of the crust. Again, it's up to you. Either choice will work.\nTo transfer the crust to the pan, we find it easiest to roll a finished crust up onto the rolling pin, then gently unroll it in the pan. Or, you can fold it gently in quarters, lift it up, position the center point on the center of the pan, and unfold it into the pan. If using waxed paper, peel off the top layer, turn the crust gently into the pan, and peel off the remaining paper. Make sure that the dough is allowed to settle completely into the pan.\nDon't stretch and press the dough into the corners; stretched dough will likely shrink back when you bake it. Instead, lift the edges of the crust to let it settle down into the corners. If the dough tears a bit, don't be concerned; it will patch easily. Using scissors or a sharp knife, trim the dough to within 3/4-inch of the rim. Use any extra scraps to patch the crust, pressing with your fingers (wet them if necessary) or set aside.\nFor a single-crust pie: Working around the rim, turn the crust under itself (not under the rim of the pan) to make a thick edge, pressing it firmly against the pan to reduce shrinkage. To decorate the rim, just press it all around with the back of a fork. For a slightly more advanced look, press the thumb and forefinger of one hand together. Use them to gently push the thick dough rim outward, while pushing inward with the forefinger of the other hand, so that they intersect in a \"V\" with the dough in between. Repeat all around the rim to make a wavy edge.\nChill the finished crust or crusts for 20 to 30 minutes before filling the pie. When the bottom crust is filled, rest the top crust on top and pinch the edges together, turning them under all the way around. To decorate the rim, just press it all around with the back of a fork. For a slightly more advanced look, press the thumb and forefinger of one hand together. Use them to gently push the thick dough rim outward, while pushing inward with the forefinger of the other hand, so that they intersect in a \"V\" with the dough in between. Repeat all around the rim to make a wavy edge.\nFor a prebaked pie or tart crust (blind baking): Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line the inside of the chilled crust with aluminum foil (don't turn it down over the rim, but leave the extra sticking up so that you have something to hold on to). Fill the foil all the way up to the top of the shell with pie weights or dried beans. Bake 25 to 30 minutes, until dry and beginning to turn \"blond\". Lift the foil and weights out of the shell and bake another 10 to 15 minutes, checking frequently to prevent overbaking, until medium brown.\nYield: 2 crusts\nPreparation time: 15 minutes plus rolling and shaping\nCooking time: 30 minutes\nEase of preparation: moderate\nRecipe courtesy Gale Gand, \"Butter Sugar Flour Eggs\" by Gale Gand, Rick Tramonto, Julia Moskin: Clarkson N.
