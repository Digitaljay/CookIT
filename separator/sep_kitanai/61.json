Place a dome lid over the top of the burger. Pour the chicken broth mixture on to the flat top so the liquid runs under the dome and creates steam to cook the burger and melt the cheese. When the burger is at desired point of doneness and the cheese is completely melted, remove the dome lid and set the burgers aside. Brush the cut sides of the buns lightly with the garlic butter. Toast the buns on the flat top until golden and crisp, 3 to 4 seconds. Flip and toast the outsides so they are also lightly toasted, 3 to 4 seconds. To assemble: Smear the \"Donkey\" Sauce on the cut side of both bun halves. Layer the base with pickle slices and the hamburger patty. Top with a bacon \"pig patty.\" Top with the onions, tomato and lettuce, and then place the top half of the bun on top. Wrap in waxed parchment paper and serve immediately.\nIn a medium saucepan, add the butter and set over medium heat. Allow the butter to melt, and then sprinkle with the flour and stir with a whisk. Cook over low heat until the butter and flour combine into a mixture like wet sand. Once combined, stir for 1 to 2 minutes to cook the flour (but without adding color). Pour in the milk slowly as you whisk to combine. Continue stirring until the mixture thickens up, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the salt, nutmeg and cheese and stir until the cheese has melted and the mixture is smooth. Set aside and keep warm until ready to use.
