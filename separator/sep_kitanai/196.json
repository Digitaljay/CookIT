Turn the heat down if the onion starts to brown.\nMeanwhile, pour the chicken broth into a separate saucepan, set over medium heat, and bring to a gentle simmer. Adjust the heat as needed to maintain this simmer the whole time you are preparing the risotto.\nOnce the onion is soft, add the rice and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, for about 3 minutes. Adjust the heat as necessary -- if the rice is cooked at too high a heat, it will turn brown and take on an undesirable flavor.\nAdding the Liquid to the Rice\nUsing a ladle, scoop up about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of broth. Pour it in the pan with the rice, stirring constantly with a spoon. After the first addition of broth, the rice mixture will look a bit soupy.\nAs the rice begins to cook, stir it constantly, making sure that you scrape along the bottom of the pan so that it does not stick. You should see little bubbles popping up on the liquid from time to time. If it bubbles more vigorously than this, turn the heat down to medium-low.\nWhen most of the liquid is absorbed into the rice and the rice begins to look a bit dry, add another ladle of broth to the pan and stir constantly, as before.\nDetermining When the Risotto Is Cooked\nContinue to add the broth in 1/2-to-3/4-cup batches and stir the rice until you have used most of the broth (this will probably take about 20 minutes). It is now time to test whether the risotto is cooked. Spoon up a grain of rice and bite into it -- it should be tender without being too mushy. If it is still crunchy and tastes a bit starchy, you will need to continue adding liquid and cooking further.\nIf it looks as if you will run out of chicken broth and your rice is still not cooked, don't be alarmed. Because of variations in individual stoves and cooking temperatures, you may need more liquid than called for in the recipe. Simply heat up another cup or 2 of chicken broth. If you run out of broth, use hot water.\nWhen the rice is tender and the risotto has a creamy consistency, almost like thick oatmeal, it is done.\nServing the Risotto\nAdd salt and pepper to the risotto, about 1/4 teaspoon at a time, until it seems well seasoned to you. Stir.\nAdd the grated Parmesan cheese and stir well.\nServe the risotto immediately in warm bowls and have extra grated Parmesan on hand.\nRisotto with Tomatoes and Basil:\nTake 4 Roma tomatoes, cut off and discard the stem tops, and cut the tomatoes into small pieces. Chop enough fresh basil leaves into small pieces to make about 1 cup. Put 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet, and turn the heat to medium-high. When the bottom of the skillet feels hot when you put your open hand 1 inch from the bottom, add the tomatoes and sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Stir for 3 or 4 minutes, until they seem soft. Put the cooked tomatoes aside, and when the risotto is done, stir the tomatoes and basil into the hot risotto. Stir to mix well; taste for salt and add some if needed. Serve immediately and pass some grated Parmesan cheese.\nRisotto with Spinach and Garlic:\nPeel and chop 3 large cloves of garlic into small pieces, and put them on a piece of waxed paper. Rinse 1/2 bunch of spinach leaves, and shake off the excess water. Cut off the stems, bunch the leaves up, and cut them into thin strips, then cut crosswise into small pieces. Put 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet and turn the heat to medium-high. When the bottom of the skillet feels hot when you put your open hand, palm side down, 1 inch from the bottom of the skillet, it is ready. Add the garlic to the oil and stir for a minute. Turn the heat to low, and add the spinach. Press the spinach down with a spatula, lightly salt and pepper it, and turn it over with a spatula. The spinach will wilt down almost immediately.

Depending on how well you space your drawing for the entire centerpiece, you will need 4 to 5 set ups of parchment paper lined sheet pans. Starting with the centerpiece layers, draw 3 round bases of gradual size: draw the first circle 8 inches in diameter, the second circle about 5 inches in diameter and the third circle about 3 inches in diameter. Fill each circle by drawing a crosshatch pattern spacing your lines 1/2 to 3/4-inch apart. Turn the traced paper over so the ink does not transfer to the pate a choux. Place the pate a choux in a piping bag with a 1/4-inch straight tip and trace the base shapes you drew.\nTo make the supports for the base: Using the same technique used to trace the 3 round bases, draw 5 curled lines that resemble a decorative letter S about 6 inches tall. These will sit between the largest and middle-sized base. Then make the same shape in a smaller size, about 3 inches tall, you will need 3 of the smaller S shapes. Turn the traced paper over so the ink does not transfer to the pate a choux. Trace the S shapes with the piping bag filled with the pate a choux.\nTo make the butterflies: begin by making the butterfly wings, draw the shape of a teardrop about 2 1/2 to 3 inches long. Draw a second tear drop, the same size as the first, they should be connected, round end to round end in order to create a wing shape. Draw 10 sets of wings, this will give you 5 butterflies. Place more pate a choux in a paper cornet (see How to Make a Cornet). Trim the tip so you can draw a very fine line. Trace the outline of the butterfly wings with the pate a choux. Then, in a freeform style, draw a narrower teardrop shape within the boundaries of each of the larger teardrops. Make sure the smaller teardrops connect with the larger teardrops at both ends. To make the body of the butterfly, using the same cornet, pipe 2-inch strips making a thick end (the head) and gradually tapering off. To make the antennae simply pipe a 1 1/2-inch V shape. You will need 5 sets of bodies and 5 sets of antennae.\nBake the pate a choux in the oven at 320 degrees F for about 20 minutes.\nHow to Make a Cornet:\nThe Cornet: A cornet is a small piping bag made from parchment paper. It is usually used to make fine decorations.\nCut an 8 by 12 by 14 1/2-inch triangle from a sheet of parchment paper.\nHold the middle of the long side of the triangle between 2 fingers of 1 hand. Take the tip of the triangle on the short, wide end and roll it toward the other tip of that same end while simultaneously pulling it in an upward motion. The tip of a cone will form where your thumb and finger hold it on the long side.\nRelease your grip from the long side, so that you are now holding the 2 corners where they meet. The paper will already resemble a partially formed cone.\nRoll the remaining tail until it is completely rolled into a cone. There will be 1 point sticking up from the open end. Fold it inside toward the center, and crease the fold. Now you should have a cornet.\nTo close the cornet once it has been filled, fold it away from the seam; this will keep the seam from opening. Use a pair of scissors or a sharp paring knife to cut an opening at the tip of the cornet to the desired size.\nPrepare the pate a choux: Place the water, salt, granulated sugar, and butter in a 4-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan, set it over medium-high heat, and bring to a boil. The butter should be completely melted by the time the mixture boils. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Add the bread flour all at once and incorporate it thoroughly with a wooden spoon.\nReturn the saucepan to the stove and cook over medium heat for about 3 minutes to dry out the paste. As it cooks, push the paste from side to side with the wooden spoon. Turn it onto itself to allow every side to touch the bottom of the saucepan, which helps it dry. Keep the paste moving, or it will burn. The paste will dry out and leave a thin film on the bottom of the saucepan.\nRemove the saucepan from the heat and transfer the paste to a large mixing bowl. Mix with an electric mixer set on low speed for about 2 minutes to release some of the steam. Continue to mix and slowly add the eggs 1 at a time, incorporating well after each addition. After each egg is added, the paste will become loose and look separated. Once each egg is well incorporated, the paste will become smooth again. The number of eggs used will vary depending on the size of the eggs and how well the pate a choux is dried. The drier it is, the more eggs you will need. After you have added 2 eggs, check the consistency by scooping a large amount of the paste onto a wooden spoon. Hold the spoon horizontally about 1foot above the bowl and watch as the batter falls from the spoon back into the bowl. If it is pale yellow, smooth, moist, slightly elastic, sticky, and takes 5 to 7 seconds to fall into the bowl, it is ready. If it appears rough, dry, and falls into the bowl in 1 big ball, it needs more eggs. Add another egg and check the consistency again after it is well incorporated.\nTo make the caramel: Place the sugar, corn syrup and water in a 1-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan and cook over medium-high heat until light golden brown. Pour the caramel into a heatproof bowl to hold the temperature of the sugar. Put a towel under the bowl to keep it from tipping and to protect your hands from the heat of the glass.\nAssemble the centerpiece: The caramel acts as glue. Dip the bottom of the first large S into the caramel and stick it to the largest base going from the out side rim of the circle, towards the center of the circle. In other words, the base supports should almost meet each other in the center of the circle. This creates a structure for the next layer to rest on. You will have to hold each S support in place in order for the caramel to harden and actually stick, keeping the S shape in the right position. Repeat using the other 4 pieces, spacing them evenly. Dip the bottom of the first small S into the caramel and stick it to the medium-sized base. Repeat using the other pieces, again spacing them evenly. Place the medium size base on the large S supports. Top the small S supports with the smallest base. You will have a 3 tiered structure.\nTo assemble the butterflies: using the caramel as glue, connect 2 sets of the wings together. Do this along length of the wings. Adjust the wings to sit at a slight angle, as though the wings are in mid-flight. Do this with all 10 wing sets, creating 5 total butterflies. Using a paring knife dipped in the caramel to spread it might be easier than dipping the wings or bodies in the bowl of caramel. You may need to prop the wings up while they harden. You can do so using 2 rolling pins or 2 thick books lying with about 2 inches between them. The space between them is where the glued center juncture will rest on the work surface and you will be able let the wings harden on a slight angle; this way you will not have to hold them in place until they harden. Using more caramel, glue the bodies to the area where you glued the wings together. Place the fatter end of the body at the top section where the wings are joined. Glue the antenna to the fatter part of the bodies. If at some point during the gluing process the caramel has become to stiff to use; place the caramel in the microwave oven at 30-second intervals, until it loosens up for you to use it again. Once the butterflies have been assembled and the caramel has hardened, you can then glue them wherever you like on the 3-tiered centerpiece.\nPlace the centerpiece on a large tray.

Roll the meat into the leaves and tie at 1/4-inch intervals.\nUsing a large measuring cup with a handle, remove 2/3 of the hot salt to a medium roasting pan. Arrange the meat on the bottom layer of salt and immediately cover it with the reserved salt, to cover completely. Turn the oven temperature down to 400 degrees F and roast about 25 minutes. Remove the meat from the oven when it reaches an internal temperature of 110 degrees F. Keep the meat wrapped in the leaves, and let rest 5 minutes.\nRemove all strings and leaves, slice, and serve with the caper sauce and the garnish of stuffed mushrooms.\nPrepare the mushrooms: Wash and dry the mushrooms; cut the edible part of their stems into 1/4-inch dice and set aside. Using a melon baller, remove all the foamy \"tubes\" inside the cap of each mushroom and discard them.\nHeat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat and sear the mushrooms 1 to 2 minutes on each side. Remove them to an ovenproof baking dish, hollow side up, and season with salt and pepper.\nAdd the onion to the same skillet and cook until translucent. Adding more oil if needed, stir in the mushroom stem dice, bread crumbs, prosciutto, parsley, basil and nuts; mixing together until well blended and cook for about 2 to 3 minutes or until heated throughout. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.\nSpoon an equal amount of the mixture into each mushroom cap. Drizzle more olive oil over the top of each mushroom and bake 10 to 15 minutes in the same oven as the beef.\nNote: The USDA recommends that beef be cooked to an internal temperature of 130 degrees F, but Madeleine prefers to remove the fillet from the oven when its internal temperature has reached 110 degrees. The meat continues to cook as it rests, resulting in a fillet that is rare to medium-rare.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees F. Cut the meat into large chunks and remove as much fat as possible. Place the meat in a large roasting pan and roast until all the juices in the pan have browned to a deep golden russet color, about 45 minutes, careful not to burn the juices.\nTransfer the meat to a large stockpot. Discard the fat in the roasting pan. Place the roasting pan over medium-high heat and add the wine, scraping up the golden brown glaze at the bottom of the pan. Add this to the stockpot together with the 10 quarts water. Bring to a boil, add the vegetables, cloves, bouquet garni, and bouillon cubes or salt. Return to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, partially cover, and simmer about 4 hours or until broth has a rich beef flavor; skimming off any scum from the surface during cooking. It may be necessary to add warm water to the pot during cooking to keep the water level approximately even throughout cooking.\nOnce the stock is finished cooking, remove from heat and allow to cool to a more manageable temperature, about 160 degrees F or higher. Strain the stock through a fine-meshed strainer either directly into storage containers or into a large bowl from which it can then be transferred into smaller storage containers. Once stock is in the storage containers, cool it down quickly by placing the containers into an ice water bath. Once cooled completely, cover and refrigerate.\nKeep containers refrigerated until all the fat has risen to the surface and hardened. To remove, break the solidified fat and discard. The stock is now ready to use. Keep refrigerated for up to 4 days or freeze for up to 6 months. To keep refrigerated stock longer, re-boil it every fourth day. Re-boil frozen stock for up to 5 minutes before using to prevent spoilage.\nYield: 10 quarts", "ingredients": ["2 (5-pound) boxes kosher salt", "1 1/2 cups primary veal stock, recipe follows", "1/4 teaspoon grated lemon rind", "2 tablespoons capers, drained", "1 small clove garlic, mashed", "1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1 head fillet of beef, about 2 1/4 pounds", "18 to 20 fresh or canned grape leaves, thoroughly dried", "6 small boleti or large shiitake mushrooms", "2 tablespoons olive oil", "Salt", "Freshly ground black pepper", "1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped", "1 3/4 cups fresh Italian bread crumbs", "3 paper-thin slices prosciutto, very finely chopped", "2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves", "2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh basil leaves", "2 tablespoons chopped pine nuts", "10 pounds veal breast or other meats", "2 cups dry white wine, preferably Sauvignon Blanc, or water", "10 quarts water", "6 medium yellow onions, quartered", "4 medium carrots, coarsely chopped", "10 large leeks, white and green parts, well washed, coarsely chopped", "1 center pale yellow celery rib with leaves", "4 cloves", "Large bouquet garni of 30 parsley stems, 2 large sprigs fresh thyme and 2 small or 1 large bay leaf", "2 (1/2-inch) chicken bouillon cubes or 2 teaspoons salt"], "title": "Beef Filet in Salt Crust", "picture_link": null}, "58678": {"instructions": "Marinade: Combine ingredients for marinade in a baking dish or shallow bowl.
