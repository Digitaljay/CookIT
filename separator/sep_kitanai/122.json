Place the roasting pan over the burners on the stove, add the mustard and Marsala to the pan and warm it over low heat. Scrape the bottom to get the drippings and tasty bits off the bottom of the pan as the Marsala reduces.\nStrain the neck out from the stock and pour about 1/2 cup into a small bowl.
