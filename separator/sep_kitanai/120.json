Cut out both circles. Measure the circumference of the pan with string, then cut a long strip of paper the length of the string and fold in half lengthwise. Grease the pan with melted butter and place one of the paper circles into the bottom. Grease, then add a second circle and grease again. Press the paper strip onto the inside edge of the pan and grease. If you're making multiple tiers, repeat with the other pans. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Put the butter and sugar into a large bowl and beat together until light and fluffy. Gradually beat in the eggs, vanilla, salt, and all-purpose flour to prevent the mixture from curdling. Add the cake flour, unsweetened cocoa, and baking powder and give it a final beat to mix together. Add the food coloring and mix well. Spoon into the prepared pan and bake for the recommended time (small 30 to 40 mins; medium 65 to 75 mins; large 75 to 85 mins). The cake is ready when firm to the touch and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes then turn out onto a cooling rack (you may need two racks side by side for the largest cake). Peel off the lining paper and let cool. Making the buttercream: Prepare the ingredients for the relevant number of tiers. You can make the buttercream in a single batch, so you'll need only one large bowl. Cream together the softened butter and confectioners' sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the cream cheese and a few drops of vanilla extract to taste. Cover the surface of the buttercream with plastic wrap and chill until ready to use. Cutting and layering the cakes Using a long-bladed serrated knife carefully cut the smallest cake in half and sandwich back together with 3 heaped tablespoons of buttercream. Spread a teaspoon of buttercream onto the center of the smallest cake board and put the cake on top (this will stop the cake sliding off the board). Cut the remaining cakes in the same way, using 6 heaped tablespoons of buttercream to sandwich the medium cake and 8 heaped tablespoons of buttercream for the large one. Place the medium cake upside down on its cake board and the large cake on the largest cake board. Spread half the remaining buttercream in a thin layer over the top and sides of the cakes to cover. Refrigerate until set to the touch and then spread the remaining buttercream over the cakes to give a perfect finish. Covering with fondant Cut a piece of string for each cake to measure the combined length of the top and sides - this will be the size to which to roll your circle of fondant. Ice just one cake at a time, as fondant can dry out very quickly. Make sure your counter is clean and dry, then knead the fondant until warm and pliable. Place 2 tablespoons of confectioners' sugar in a small sifter and use to lightly dust your counter. Roll out the fondant to 1/6in (3 to 4mm) thick and keep turning so that it stays circular. Carefully slide your hands and arms under the fondant, then lift centrally over the cake and lay onto the buttercream (you could use a large rolling pin for this instead - simply hold the pin over the center of the fondant and flip the paste over it. Lift, then position and roll over the cake). Dust your hands with a little confectioners' sugar and rub them gently over the cake to make sure the fondant has stuck to the buttercream underneath. Use a sharp long-bladed knife to trim the edges, cutting downward cleanly (keep wiping the knife blade, or the paste will build up and make it difficult to get a clean cut). Repeat with the remaining cakes and fondant. Save any trimmings to make decorations, flowers, or frills - keep well wrapped in plastic wrap until ready to use, to prevent from drying out. Stacking the cakes\nTo stack the cakes, you'll need the help of some dowel rods, because the sponge and frosting are too soft to support the weight of each other. Dowels can be bought from specialty cake stores; however, as every cake is different they do need to be cut to size. Only the bottom two tiers need them, so you will need eight rods in total. Hold a rod at the side of the cake and mark with a pencil where the frosting comes to. Cut the rod and three others to the same length. Push the rods into the cake about 2in (5cm) away from the sides, to form the four corners of a square in the center of the cake. They should not rise above the level of the frosting. If you have miscalculated and the dowel is too long, remove it and shave off any excess with a sharp knife. Measure, then cut and insert the rods in the same way for the medium cake. The three cakes can now be stacked directly on to each other. Once they're stacked, it's best not to move them about, so it's safest to assemble them at your venue or in the position you want them to be displayed.

Prepare two baking sheets by greasing them and lining with parchment.\nSift the matzo cake meal, potato starch and salt together, set aside. In a mixer whip the eggs and sugar, for about 8 minutes.\nThe eggs should be very light in color and a thick foam. At the very end, add the vanilla and zest.\nSift the dry ingredients over the egg foam.\nVery gently, but thoroughly, fold the dry ingredients into the egg foam.\nPour the batter into one of the prepared pans and spread evenly with a spatula.\nBake the cake for about 18 minutes or until golden and dry when poked with a cake tester. Repeat with the second cake layer.\nTo make the buttercream:\nIn a small pot, fitted with a candy thermometer, heat 2 cups sugar, water and cream of tartar to 242 degrees F. This will take several minutes, so get your eggs started.\nWhisk together the eggs, yolks and 1/3 cup sugar. Beat the eggs on medium high speed until light in color and thick.\nOnce the sugar has reached 242 degrees F, add it very carefully and slowly to the eggs, while the beater is going on slow speed. Be sure to pour the syrup along the edge of the bowl, not directly onto the beater or it will splatter. Continue beating the egg mixture on medium-high speed until the eggs have cooled, about 8 minutes.\nOnce the eggs are cooled, add the butter 2 tablespoons at a time. The mixture will go through a stage when it looks soupy and curdled, but keep adding the butter and it will come together. After all the butter is added, mix in the vanilla.\nThe buttercream will be smooth and glossy.\nDivide 1/3 of the buttercream into a separate bowl and add the poppy seed paste.\nTo the remaining buttercream, add the melted chocolate.\nIf you are not going to use the buttercream right away, cover it and leave it at room temperature for up to 24 hours. When you are ready to use it, give it a good stirring or put it back in the mixer and beat with the paddle attachment until smooth.\nTo make the soaking syrup:\nIn a small saucepan heat the sugar, water and zest over medium heat until the sugar has fully dissolved.\nCut each sheet of cake into 4 equal pieces (they will be about 4 inches wide and 12 inches long).\nLay the first layer of cake on the serving platter and brush with the soaking syrup. You want to dab the syrup on, but don't overly saturate the cake or it will be soggy.\nSpread a thin layer of the poppy seed buttercream over the soaked layer.\nRepeat with 5 more layers and then finish with the 7th layer of cake. This will leave you with one extra. Since my cake is not traditional anyway, you should feel free to use up that last layer. If you want to keep it to seven layers, then I suggest you use that lonely extra layer as a snack.\nIf your layers need squaring up, just trim them with a sharp serrated bread knife.\nStir the chocolate buttercream to make sure it is smooth and cover the entire cake in a nice even layer.\nIt is okay if it isn't perfectly smooth, because we're going to add some rough stripes to the outside.\nTake a small blob of buttercream on the end of your spatula,\nand starting at the end of the cake, on the bottom, spread that blob in a stripe along the cake. Repeat over and over again, but alternate which side you start on. Repeat this on the top as well.\nYou will end up with rough stripes all over the cake, which gives the cake some texture.\nUsing a sharp chef's knife, scrape the smooth side of a bar of chocolate with the blade, so that the chocolate curls up.

Sprinkle the remaining water over it, reserving one tablespoon. Transfer the mixture to a large mixing bowl, drizzle the ice water evenly over it and toss like a salad until the dough comes together in a ragged mass. Add the remaining water if necessary. Cover in plastic wrap and chill.\nMeanwhile, place the remaining butter between layers of plastic wrap and pound with a rolling pin to make malleable. Place it between two sheets of plastic wrap and, using your hands or a rolling pin, shape it into a 6-inch square.\nRemove the dough from the fridge, lightly flour the work surface and, using either your hands or a rolling pin, shape the mass into 12-inch square. Place the butter on the dough catty-corner and fold the edges of the dough into the center to enclose it.\nLightly flour the surface of the dough and roll it into a rectangle measuring about 12 inches high x 26 inches wide. If the dough sticks, loosen it underneath with a long flexible metal palette knife and scrape off any butter sticking to the work surface. Brush off any excess flour. Fold the dough into thirds and turn it 90 degrees, so that seams are parallel to the table's edge. This is called a \"turn\". Lightly flour and roll it out again to about 12 x 26 inches. Brush off the excess flour and again fold it into thirds. Place the dough on a sheet tray, cover it with a plastic bag and refrigerate for 20 to 30 minutes.\nRepeat this, giving the dough two more turns, each time rolling it out to 12 x 26 inches. Refrigerate for another 20 or 30 minutes, then give the dough 2 final turns. There are six turns in all.\nLightly roll it to flatten and even it.

On a floured table, roll the rectangle of dough to a length of 15 inches and a width of 10 inches. Dust off any excess flour. Roll the dough up onto the rolling pin and transfer it to the sheet tray. Using a 10-inch rolling pin and rolling gently from the center out, roll the dough to fit the tray. Make sure it is even - with no lumpy edges. Rolling lightly and gently enables you to keep it even.\nShapes to cut out of the 3/8-inch thick dough:\nBouchee: Cut 2 (3-1/2-inch) rounds of dough. Cut a 2-1/4-inch circle out of the second round. Egg wash the first round. Place the ring from the second round over the first so that the edges line up. Dock the edges and center with a fork. Thin inner circle can be baked as well and used for a lid.\nBouchee made from special cutter: Use and cutter made especially for this purpose. It has two cutting edges - one inside and shorter than the other that scores, rather than cuts the dough.\nCriss-cross Tartlet: Cut a 5-inch square. Fold it into a triangle and cut from each edge towards the apex, stopping about 1/2-inch short of the apex. The cut should be about 1/2-inch from the edge. Open it up to the square and place on a cookie sheet. Egg wash the edges. Bring one point over to the opposite corner of the inner square and press. Bring the opposite point over and press. Press along the rim to seal. Dock rim and center.\nPuff Strip: From a sheet tray of frozen dough, cut a rectangular piece 8\" wide and the length of the sheet tray. Transfer it to a paper lined cookie sheet. Using a pizza wheel, cut a 3/4\" strip from each edge. Egg wash the edges of the center piece and flip the cut strips onto the egg washed edge. Dock the 2 rims with a fork, then dock down the center.\nVol-au-Vent: Similar to above, but round. Press whatever size round you want into the dough on the sheet tray. Lift and cut along the circular impression with a pizza wheel. Center another round, and inch or so smaller in diameter than the first over the circle of dough and press lightly. Remove and cut along this line. Egg was the edge, as above, and cut through the outer rim in one place. Place the rim over the center circle, lining up the edges.
