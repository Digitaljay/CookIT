Slowly add the rest of the flour (approximately 6 cups) to the mixture until a soft, moist dough is formed and the dough no longer clings to the outside of the bowl. You may need a little more or less flour. Knead the dough until gluten is formed (it is critical that the gluten be formed or you will get a heavy bread). The dough should be smooth and spring back when pressed, about 8 to 10 minutes. You can also check to see if gluten is formed by doing the \"window test\". The window test is when the dough can be stretched and it doesn't break, but will stretch and create a translucent membrane or window.\nRub 1 teaspoon of sunflower oil around a large bowl.

The paper cone was 3 1/2 inches tall with a 2 1/2-inch diameter opening. You can use any mold that you like. If you use the paper cones, place them point side down inside small glasses to make it easy to fill them. Use a serrated knife to slice the pound cake into 1/2-inch thick layers. Use a round cutter to cut cake rounds the same diameter as the cone mold. Pour the heavy cream into a medium-size mixing bowl and whip to soft peaks with an electric mixer set on medium speed. At this stage, the whipped cream has the most volume. If you overwhip the cream, you will lose volume and the mousse will not be as light and airy as it should be. If you are using fruit flavored alcohol, fold it in with a rubber spatula, being careful not to deflate the cream. Carefully pour the warm melted chocolate into the mixture. If the chocolate is too warm, it will melt the whipped cream. If it is too cool, the chocolate will seize (harden) upon contact with the cooler mixture and you will have pieces of chocolate in your mousse. Use a rubber spatula to gently fold in the chocolate until completely incorporated. The chocolate mousse should be the same color throughout, with no streaks. Place the chocolate mousse in a large pastry bag (no tip). Drop a few cherries into the tip of each paper cone. Pipe the chocolate mousse into the cone so that it is about 1/4-inch from the top. Close each cone with 1 cake round, gently pressing the cake round into the mousse. Invert the cone and place it on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Place the desserts in the freezer for 2 hours. To make the chocolate decorations: Use a small offset spatula to spread some tempered chocolate on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet. Keep the thickness of the chocolate as even as possible, about 1/8-inch thick. Use a sharp paring knife to cut some long triangles of chocolate that are about 15 inches long with a 1 1/2-inch base. Cut 1 triangle for each dessert you are making. When the chocolate has set slightly, place it inside a large round tube or bucket. I made my tube of aluminum flashing that I taped into a 15-inch diameter. Place the chocolate triangles inside the tube and let the chocolate set. When set, remove the acetate from the tube. Peel off the parchment paper and break apart the curved triangles. This piece forms the moon for each dessert.\nMake the chocolate sauce cups: Use a spoon to fill a round measuring tablespoon with chocolate. When it is full, empty it into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the spoon should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the edge of the spoon clean on the side of the bowl and place it upside down on a wire rack placed over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the edge clean with a paring knife. When the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the spoon. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the spoon in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. Unmold. Repeat to make 1 sauce cup for each dessert. Make a chocolate tube: Roll a piece of parchment paper into a tube that has a 2-inch diameter. Fill the tube with chocolate. Then invert it and let the excess chocolate flow back into the bowl. Spin the tube while inverted to ensure the inside is completely and evenly covered. Allow this to set until firm. Remove the parchment paper. Use a hot serrated knife to slice the tube into 1 1/2-inch wide slices. Cut 1 slice for each dessert. To do this, heat the knife under very hot water and wipe it dry. Hold the knife blade against the side of the chocolate where you want to make the cut. Do not press on the knife or the chocolate will break. Allow the heat of the knife to \"cut\" through the chocolate by melting it. Assemble the chocolate decoration: Dip the side of the tube piece in tempered chocolate and place the tube on a glass plate. Use tempered chocolate to adhere the moon to the top of the tube piece. Use more chocolate to adhere the chocolate sauce cup to the top of the moon. To unmold the dessert: Fill a bowl with very hot water. Dip the outside of the frozen dessert in the hot water for about 2 seconds. Be careful not to allow the water to seep into the opening. Invert the dessert and gently pinch the tip. The frozen dessert should release from the mold. To spray the dessert: Place a mixture of 50 percent cocoa butter and 50 percent chocolate in a saucepan. Heat it until warm. Make sure there are no lumps. Transfer this mixture to the container of the paint sprayer. Spray the dessert with this mixture to give it texture, color and contrast. Use an offset spatula to move the frozen dessert to the base of the chocolate moon. Fill a squeeze bottle with raspberry sauce and fill the chocolate sauce cup.\nSources: Laser thermometer Paint sprayer: art supply store", "ingredients": ["Chocolate pound cake, store bought", "1 pint plus 3 tablespoons heavy cream, whipped", "Kirsch or any cherry flavored alcohol", "7 1/2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, melted", "Cherries, canned", "2 pounds bittersweet chocolate, tempered", "Cocoa butter, for spray painting", "Dessert sauce, store bought"], "title": "Chocolate Moon Dessert", "picture_link": "es0dPSykr4mb3ewSq1ZjY.vLpy4EA6a"}, "27269": {"instructions": "In a bowl combine cinnamon and sugar.

Stirring with a wooden spoon, add the flour all at once and stir hard until all the flour is incorporated, 30 to 60 seconds. Return the pan to the heat and cook, stirring, to cook off some of the moisture, 30 seconds.\nScrape the mixture into a bowl. Using a hand mixer set on low to medium speed, add 8 of the eggs, one at a time, stopping after each addition to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Mix until the dough is smooth and glossy and the eggs are completely incorporated. The dough should be thick, but should fall slowly and steadily from the beaters when you lift them out of the bowl.\nTransfer the mixture to a pastry bag fitted with a large plain round tip. Pipe the dough in big dollops onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Whisk the remaining 1 egg with 1 tablespoon water. Brush the surface of the dough with the egg wash to push down any points. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375 degrees F, and bake until puffed up and light golden brown, about 20 minutes more. The puffs should have a crust, but also still be soft. Avoid opening the oven door while the puffs bake. Cool the puffs on the baking sheet.\nFor the fillings: In a medium saucepan set over medium heat, cook the milk until it just begins to bubble along the edges. In a bowl, whisk the sugar and yolks until light and fluffy. Add the cornstarch and whisk vigorously until no lumps remain. Whisk in 1/4 cup of the hot milk until incorporated, being careful to avoid scrambling the eggs. Whisk in the remaining hot milk mixture, reserving the empty saucepan for a later use.\nPour the pastry cream through a fine mesh strainer back into the saucepan and cook over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until it thickens and comes to a slow boil. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter and vanilla extract. Remove one-third of the pastry cream to a bowl. Then add the chocolate into the larger batch of pastry cream and stir until the chocolate is completely incorporated. Divide the chocolate cream into two bowls, adding the mint to one batch and the orange to the other. Add the melted caramel and cinnamon to the plain pastry cream, stirring to combine. Cover all three creams with plastic wrap, lightly pressing the plastic against the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Chill for at least 2 hours or until ready to serve.\nUse a plain pastry tip to poke a hole in the bottom of each puff. Place each of the pastry creams into a piping bag fitted with a small tip. Separate the puffs into three equal piles and fill each pile with one of the pastry creams.\nFor the caramel: Place the sugar, corn syrup and 2/3 cup water in a saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer. Bring to a boil and cook until the mixture reaches a deep amber color, the thermometer will read about 350 degrees F. Remove from the heat. Then quickly but carefully, dip the bottom and sides of the puffs in the caramel to start building the tower. Create a large circle of puffs as the base, then a second, slightly smaller circle on top of the first to draw the circle in and create a tower of cream puffs. Repeat for the remaining puffs.

Fill a pie pan with the fruit, sprinkling sugar over each layer, and mounding it up toward the center of the pan. Pour the water into the pan to come halfway up to the fruit.\nRoll out the dough. Cut off a thin strip and attach it to the rim of the pan, brushing the rim with water first. Brush the strip with water and cover the pan with the sheet of dough, cutting off all the overhanging bits. Crimp the edges, brush the top with eggwash, and strew over the demerara sugar. Bake for 20 minutes before turning the temperature down to 375 degrees F and cooking for a further 20 minutes. Eat warm or hot with heavy cream.\nShortcrust Pastry dough:\nUse approximately twice the weight of all purpose flour (preferably organic) to unsalted butter. Some recipes call for half butter, half lard.\nSift the flour and a pinch of sea salt into a food processor, then cut the cold butter into small pieces on top of it. I process it for 20 to 30 seconds, then add ice-cold water through the top, a tablespoon at a time, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes should be enough for about 10 ounces of dough, with the machine running. If the paste is still in crumbly little bits after 1 or 2 minutes, add a tablespoon more water, but remember, the more water you use, the more the crust will shrink if you bake it blind. One solution is to use a bit of cream or egg yolk instead of water. The moment the dough has cohered into a single ball, stop, remove it, wrap it in plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.\nIf you're making pastry dough by hand, sift the flour into a large bowl with the salt, add the chopped butter, and work as briskly as you can to rub the fat into the flour. Use the tip of your fingers only, rather like running grains of hot sand through your fingers. Add the water bit by bit as above; wrap and chill the dough.\nIf you're making a double crust pie, divide the dough into roughly 2/3 and 1/3. Then scatter a bit of flour on your work surface, roll your rolling pin in it, dust the palms of your hands, and start rolling. Always roll away from yourself, tuning the dough as you go, and keep the rolling pin and work surface floured to prevent sticking.\nBaking Blind:\nPreheat the oven to 375 to 400 degrees F.\nLine your greased pie pan with dough. Never stretch it; it will stretch back. Try to leave at least 30 minutes for the unbaked dough to commune with the inside of your fridge. Or put it in the night before you need it.\nTear off a piece of waxed paper a little larger than the pie pan and place it over the dough. Cover the paper with a layer of dried beans; the idea is to prevent the pastry from rising up in the oven. When the dough is nearly cooked (the timing depends on the rest of the recipe), remove the paper and beans and prick the bottom of the pie shell to let out trapped air that would otherwise bubble up. Return the tart to the oven for 5 to 10 minutes to dry the bottom. Brushing the partly baked pie shell with a light coating of beaten egg or egg white ensure a crisp finished tart.\nSift the flour and salt into a mixing bowl. Rub in 2 tablespoons of the butter, as for shortcrust pastry dough, or use a food processor. Mix in the water and then gently knead the dough on a floured surface, preferably marble. Wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.\nKeep the rest of the butter out so that it softens, then flatten it into a rectangle 1 inch thick. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into the same size as the butter. Place the butter in the center of the pastry and then fold over the top and bottom of the dough to cover the butter.\nWith the rolling pie, press down on the edges to seal in the butter, then give the dough a quarter turn clockwise. Now roll the dough out so that it returns to it's original length. Fold over the ends again, press them together with the rolling pin, and give a further quarter turn clockwise. Repeat the process once more, then rest the dough in the fridge for at least 30 minutes, remembering which way it is facing.\nRepeat the rolling and turning process twice more, then refrigerate for a final 30 minutes before using or freezing.
