Season generously with salt. Using your fingertips carefully work your way under the skin of the chickens to separate the skin from the breast to develop a pocket. Schmear the herb paste under the skin of both chickens. Use all of the paste and try to distribute evenly. Drizzle each chicken with more olive oil and massage the skin. The idea here is to lube them up like suntan lotion. This will really help to get a nice brown crispy skin. Sprinkle each chicken generously with salt. Truss each chicken.\nPlace the diced veggies, bay leaves and thyme bundle in a roasting pan large enough to accommodate the 2 chickens without touching. Usually a 9 by 13-inch roasting pan will be perfect. Add 2 cups of chicken stock and season generously with salt. Arrange the chickens on top of the veggies in the roasting pan and place in the preheated oven.\nCheck the chickens about 15 minutes into the cooking process, the skin should be starting to turn a lovely brown. Lower the heat to 375 degrees F and continue roasting. After another 15 minutes, remove the chickens from the oven and turn over. At this point check the level of liquid in the roasting pan. If most of the liquid has evaporated, add another cup of stock and return the chickens to the oven. When the chickens have browned on the bottom, about 15 minutes, remove them from the oven and turn them back over. Return the chickens to the oven for the final 15 minutes of cooking. During this time the skin on the chickens should be very brown and crispy. Remove the chickens from the oven and take the temperature in the crease between the thigh and the breast. (When doing this be sure not to have the thermometer probe touch a bone or you will get an inaccurate reading.) The thermometer should read between 160 and 170 degrees F. When cooking poultry in general the rule is 17 minutes per pound. If the thermometer reads less than 160 degrees F return the chicken to the oven for an additional 10 minutes and then re-check the temperature.\nWhen chickens have reached the proper temp remove them from the roasting pan, place them on a warm platter and cover loosely with foil. Let sit for at least 10 to 15 minutes before carving.\nAfter the chickens have been removed from the roasting pan, skim off the excess fat from the surface of the liquid. The easiest way to do this is to prop up 1 end of the pan and allow the fat to run to the other end of the pan. You may not be able to get all of the fat, which is ok-fat tastes good! Put the roasting pan on a burner, add the wine, bring to a medium heat and reduce by half. Add the remaining chicken stock and taste. Add salt if needed- you probably will need salt. At this point you can decide if you are a \"strainer\" or not a strainer, meaning if you would like to strain the chunky vegetables out of the sauce or not. I myself, am not a strainer. When the sauce has reached the desired consistency and flavor remove from the heat and pour into desired serving vessel.\nTo carve the chickens: Cut off the twine. Pull the thigh and leg away from the breast of the chicken until the thigh bone \"pops\" out of the socket. This is also a sign that the chicken is cooked properly. Separate the thigh and drumstick.

Line two 9 1/2-by-14-inch jelly-roll pans with parchment paper, leaving 1 inch of paper hanging over on all sides (this will help you lift the cakes out of the pan after baking). In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the yolks and 1 cup of the sugar on medium speed until the mixture is thick and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the vanilla and mix for 1 minute. Scrape into a medium mixing bowl and set aside. Wash the stand mixer bowl and whisk very well (even the smallest amount of yolk will prevent the whites from whipping properly). Put the whites and salt in the mixer bowl whisk at medium speed until he whites become frothy. Slowly add the remaining 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar. Increase the speed to high and whip until the whites become glossy and almost firm (the whites should not become dry). Remove the bowl from the mixer. Sift the cocoa over the egg yolk mixture and gently fold in one-third of the whites (this will help to prevent overmixing). Add the remaining whites and carefully fold until there are no visible streaks of white. Divide the batter between the two pans. Smooth the batter evenly with an offset spatula. Bake the cakes just until they have risen and feel like soft marshmallows, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the pans to wire racks and let the cakes cool to room temperature. Chill the cakes until cold, about 30 minutes. While the cakes are cooling, prepare the buttercream. For the peanut buttercream: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and peanut butter on medium speed until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Turn the speed to low, add the confectioners' sugar, salt and vanilla and mix for another 2 minutes. Add the cream, turn the speed to high, and beat for 1 minute. Cover and set aside. When cooled, remove the cakes from the refrigerator. Gently lift one cake from the pan, using the overhanging parchment as handles, and place it on a cutting board. Carefully separate the paper from the cake. Lay a piece of parchment on top of the cake and quickly flip the cake over. Remove the parchment and replace with a clean sheet of parchment. With a rolling pin, firmly roll over the cake to even it out and thin it out. Trim each cake to a 12-by-9-inch rectangle. Place in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes; this firms it up, and if the cake is stuck to the parchment this allows you to flip one more time to release the paper. Repeat with the remaining cake. Spread a thin layer of jelly over the surface of both cakes. Divide the buttercream between the cakes and spread it evenly over the jelly, leaving a border at the top of one long side. (The rolls look best when the cake layer and buttercream layer are the same thickness.) Begin rolling up the cakes, one at a time, starting at a long side. The first roll is the most important-keep it tight. Continue rolling toward the top. It's best to go slowly and carefully. When you completed rolling a cake into a log, place it in the center of a new sheet of parchment. Take the paper above the roll and cover the roll with a little overlap. Now take a flat-edge utensil, like a bench scraper or a long spatula, and force it underneath the roll and push tight. This helps fill in any air pockets in the roll. Chill the rolls 15 to 20 minutes or overnight before cutting them; the colder, the better. For the chocolate shell: Put the chopped chocolate in a heatproof bowl and set it over a pan with 3 inches of simmering water. When the chocolate is completely melted, stir in the butter and oil. Set aside in a warm place.\nRemove the paper from the rolls. With a sharp knife, cut each roll into 6 even pieces; each will be about 2 inches wide. Place a screen over a sheet pan to allow excess chocolate to drip off. Working with one piece at a time, place a piece into the chocolate shell. Flip the piece over using a fork. Lift it out of the chocolate and tap off excess chocolate before setting it on the screen. Continue until each roll is completely coated. Move each roll slightly on the screen during drying so it doesn't stick. Once dry, carefully lift off the rolls and arrange them on a sheet pan.

Lower heat slightly and boil gently for five minutes occasionally mashing mixture. Mash in sugar, add the water and return to a boil for 1 minute. You just made jam. Cool, jar, refrigerate and enjoy within 2 weeks. Or, move to the preserving phase. Preserving the jam: Thoroughly wash all hardware in hot soapy water. Then pile everything (excluding the jar lids) into the pot. Cover with hot water by at least 1-inch and bring to a boil and maintain for 10 full minutes to sterilize. Turn off the heat, wait 5 minutes then add the lids (waiting will insure that the sealing compound does not melt). Leave all hardware in the pot until you're ready to can.\nRemove the ladle, tongs, funnel and other tools from the pot, (careful please, it's hot in there) to a clean towel or paper towels. Using the jar tongs, remove and drain the jars, placing them on the towel/paper towel surface. (Avoid rock or metal surfaces which could result in thermal shock and breakage.)\nPlace the funnel in the first jar (pick it up by the ring, avoiding the sterile interior.) Use the ladle to fill each jar just to the bottom of the funnel, about 1/3-inch from the bottom of the jar threads. This \"headspace\" is necessary for the jars to seal during processing.\nWipe the jar rims with a moist paper towel, checking for any cracks or irregularities as you go. Use the magnetized device of your choice to position lids on each jar. Screw the rings on finger tight. (Remember, the rings don't seal the jars they only hold the lids in place. Heat will drive out the headspace air, which when cooled will create a vacuum, thus sealing the jars)\nReturn the jars to the pot being certain that they don't touch the bottom of the pot or each other. (If you don't have a jar rack, try a round cake rack, or metal mesh basket. Even a folded kitchen towel on the pot bottom will do in a pinch.) Add additional water if necessary to cover the jars by at least an inch, and bring to a hard boil over high heat according to the table below. (Be sure not to start your timer until a true boil is reached. The headroom air may bubble out of the jars before a boil is reached.
