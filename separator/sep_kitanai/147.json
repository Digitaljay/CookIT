Make sure the packet is airtight by pressing down on it gently with your hand. If air escapes easily, rewrap.\nPlace foil packets on the top rack of the dishwasher.

Bake foil-wrapped packets in a preheated 400 degree F oven for 12 minutes.\nThe Instruction Manual: 1. Seal individual-size fillets in aluminum foil. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO COOK A WHOLE FISH. 2. Place fish packets on the top rack. 3. Add dirty dishes and lemon-scented soap. This optional step is not recommended for novices. However, as long as the salmon is tightly sealed in the aluminum foil, it will not absorb any soapy taste or smell. 4. Set the dishwasher to the \"normal\" cycle. Modern dishwashers have \"economy\" and \"cool dry\" settings, which are undesirable because they conserve heat. However, on the other end of the spectrum, the \"pots and pans\" setting tends to overcook the fish. 5. Run salmon through the entire wash-and-dry cycle: approximately 50 minutes for most models. I have poached salmon in almost every make and model, and although the temperatures and duration of the cycles vary with each machine, a little more or less \"washing\" will not affect it greatly because salmon is extremely forgiving. 6. To heighten the drama for your disbelieving guests, and to prove that you have nothing up your sleeve, let them crowd around the dishwasher when you load the salmon. When the cycle is complete, invite them back to witness the unloading. 7. Troubleshoot. The only time I ever had a problem was on live national TV. Five minutes before going on the air I learned that the heating element in the on-camera dishwasher was broken. After a quick huddle with the producer, I was forced to make the most of the situation by baking the salmon in the (gasp!) oven.

Heat your flour tortilla in a frying pan or the microwave for just a few seconds. Fill your burrito with your scramble, beans, rice and any other toppings you like. My favorites are listed above. The possibilities to vary your burrito fillings are endless. This is a great way to get a complete, healthy and balanced meal quickly, all wrapped up in a tortilla and ready to go. It will provide great fuel for your day.\nI recommend quick-soaking beans rather than cold soaking overnight, as quick-soaking makes some of the starches more digestible. To quick soak, rinse the beans and place in a large pot. Cover with cold water to about 3 inches above the top of the beans. Bring the pot to a boil, cover and immediately remove from the heat. Let sit for 1 hour, drain, rinse and return the beans to the pot.\nCover the beans with fresh cold water to 3 to 4 inches above the level of the beans (this will require more water than the previous time, as the beans will have expanded during the quick soak). Add to the pot the carrot, celery, onion, garlic, thyme, parsley, bay leaf and salt. All the vegetables can and should be left whole, as they will be easier to remove later. (I add the salt at the beginning of cooking, as I find it adds better flavor to the beans. Many people believe that adding salt too early will make the beans tough, but I have never found this to be the case.) Bring the liquid to a boil, and immediately reduce to the barest simmer, just barely bubbling very gently. Cook, uncovered, until the beans are done, roughly 1 to 2 hours. The timing will vary greatly with the size and variety of beans, the size of your pot, your elevation, the weather, etc. Just taste-test along the way until they are fully cooked through but not mushy. Once done, remove the pot from the heat. I generally remove all the aromatics and then store the beans in their own cooking liquid in the fridge in a sealed container. They will last 1 to 2 weeks that way. The liquid is delicious. Yield: makes enough for 6 to 10 burritos, depending on appetite.\nIn a medium saucepan heat the oil over medium heat.
