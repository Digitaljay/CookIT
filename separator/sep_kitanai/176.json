When that has set, repeat the procedure using bittersweet chocolate. Let the chocolate set slightly. If you want to trim the outside edge to a specific shape, use a paring knife to make that cut before the chocolate has set completely. When the chocolate is set, peel off the bubble wrap.\nFor the Tube: Cut a piece of acetate the length and width of the tube you would like to make, and set it on your work surface. Make cocoa butter paint by mixing cocoa butter with powdered food coloring to desired consistency, and place it in a shallow dish. Dip the stenciled paint roller in the cocoa butter paint and roll onto the acetate. When the paint has set, use an offset spatula to spread a 1/4-inch-thick layer of white chocolate over the painted acetate paper. Roll the acetate into a tube so the acetate is on the outside and tape it closed. Set aside and allow the chocolate to set. When the chocolate has set, remove the acetate. If you need to trim the tube to fit your presentation, heat a chef's knife and let the heat of the knife cut the chocolate. Do not apply pressure or your tube will break.\nFor the Dome: Coat the inside of your dome mold with cocoa butter paint. When the chocolate has set, use a ladle to fill the mold with white chocolate. (It will make an interesting marbled effect if you spread the chocolate around with your fingers.) When the mold is full, empty the chocolate back into the bowl. The inside of the mold should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the lip of the mold clean and place it upside down on a wire rack over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the lip of the mold clean again with a paring knife. This is important because when the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden. When the chocolate has set, unmold it by gently pressing on one side of the chocolate. The chocolate should release easily.\nFor the Textured Plastic: Cut shapes from heavy textured plastic. Spread chocolate all the way to the edge of the plastic and let it set. When it has set, carefully peel the plastic away from the chocolate and set aside. You can make textured chocolate triangles by using a sharp paring knife to cut out triangles when the chocolate is partially set. Tile the triangles so they overlap slightly and use chocolate to \"glue\" them together. If trimming is necessary, use a hot chef's knife to \"cut\" the chocolate.\nFor the Sea Sponge: Using sea sponge dipped in cocoa butter paint, sponge paint onto an acetate sheet. Another method is to spread white chocolate onto an acetate sheet, let it set, then sponge paint on top of the chocolate.\nFor the Marbled Chocolate Box: Using a spoon, drizzle white and bittersweet chocolate inside a plastic box. Use your fingers to spread the chocolate and create a marbled effect. Using a ladle, fill the box with white chocolate, and when it's full, empty it back into the bowl of chocolate. The inside of the box should be evenly coated with chocolate. Wipe the lip of the plastic box clean and place the box upside down on a wire rack over a baking sheet. Once the chocolate starts to harden, about 5 minutes, scrape the lip of the box clean again with a paring knife. This is important because when the chocolate sets, it shrinks or retracts from the sides of the mold. A clean edge will keep it from sticking and cracking as it shrinks. You can place the mold in the refrigerator for several minutes to help the chocolate to harden.\nIf you are very adventurous, you can give the molded box an interesting finish by using a paint spray gun instead, however the spray gun must be unused. Start by placing the mold in the freezer for 10 minutes. Mix equal parts of cocoa butter and melted chocolate together and strain the mixture. Pour it into the spray gun container, making sure it is very warm.

There are a variety of ways to temper.\nOne of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate's residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer.\nAnother way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk.\nThe classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess.\nA simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes.", "ingredients": ["16 ounces white chocolate, tempered", "32 ounces bittersweet chocolate, tempered", "Cocoa butter, melted", "Powdered food coloring"], "title": "Do It Yourself Chocolate Sculpture", "picture_link": "es0dPSykr4mb3ewSq1ZjY.vLpy4EA6a"}, "52664": {"instructions": "Mix water and yeast and let stand 15 minutes.

Lightly grease a 9 1/4-inch (23 cm) fluted tart pan with removable bottom. Whisk the flour, cornmeal, cornstarch, and salt in a medium bowl until well blended. 2. Put the butter and confectioners' sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a large bowl using an electric handheld mixer fitted with wire beaters). Beat on medium speed until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes. Add the rosemary and vanilla and beat on medium until blended and fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the flour mixture and beat on low speed until the dough forms moist clumps. Dump the dough into the prepared pan. Using lightly floured fingertips, press the dough into the pan to form an even layer. Make sure to press the dough into the scalloped edges to form a clean edge. Sprinkle the fleur de sel or sanding sugar, if using, evenly over the top. 3. Using the tip of a knife or a bench scraper, score the dough all the way through, forming 16 wedges. With the tines of a fork, prick each wedge twice all the way through, starting at the widest part of the wedge and spacing them about 1/2 inch (12 mm) apart. Lightly flour the tines of the fork as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking. Slide the pan into the freezer or fridge for about 10 minutes while the oven heats. 4. Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C/gas 2). 5. Bake the shortbread until the top looks dry and very pale brown, 39 to 41 minutes. Move the pan to a rack. Using a small paring or serrated knife (I don't use a bench scraper for this because it compresses the cookies' edges), immediately recut the wedges using the scored lines as a guide. Let the shortbread cool completely before removing them from the pan. 6. Serve the cookies with a dusting of confectioners' sugar.\nInstead of the rosemary, use one of the following combinations: Double ginger: 2 tsp. finely grated fresh ginger + 1/3 cup (1 3/8 oz./39 g) finely chopped crystallized ginger (add both with the vanilla). Cinnamon toast: 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon added to the flour + 1 Tbs. granulated sugar mixed with 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon sprinkled over the shortbread and pressed lightly into the dough before baking. Espresso chip: 1/2 tsp. instant espresso powder (dissolved in the vanilla extract) + 1/3 cup (2 oz./57 g) finely chopped bittersweet chocolate.\nTo make rectangular cookies: Line the bottom of an 8-inch (20 cm) square baking pan (the straight-sided type makes for a cleaner-looking cookie) with parchment. Prepare the dough as directed. Using lightly floured fingertips, press the dough into the pan to form an even layer. Using the tip of a knife or a bench scraper (my tool of choice), score the dough all the way through, forming 1 x 2-inch (2.5 x 5 cm) bars. With the tines of a fork, prick each bar two or three times all the way through, spacing them evenly and on the diagonal. Lightly flour the tines of the fork as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking. Proceed as directed.\nTo make round cookies: Have ready two cookie sheets lined with parchment or nonstick liners. Prepare the dough as directed. Arrange a large piece of parchment on the work surface and scrape the dough onto the center. Cover with another piece of parchment and press down on the dough to flatten. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough between the parchment to a 1/4-inch (6 mm) thickness, turning, lifting, and repositioning the parchment and lightly flouring throughout the rolling. Slide the dough onto a cookie sheet and refrigerate until firm, at least 30 minutes. Remove the top piece of parchment from the chilled dough. Using a 2 1/2-inch (6 cm) round cookie cutter, cut out rounds. Using the end of a straw, punch out three holes in the center of each round. Arrange about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart on the prepared cookie sheets. Stack the scraps, gently press together, reroll, chill, and cut as directed.
