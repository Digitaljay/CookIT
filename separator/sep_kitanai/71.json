Bring a pan of water to a simmer, remove from the heat, and place the bowl of chocolate over the water. Be careful that the bottom of the bowl does not touch the surface of the water or the chocolate will overheat. Stir the chocolate frequently as it is melting. Take the chocolate's temperature occasionally, to make sure that it does not exceed 120 degrees F.\nRemove the bowl from the water; dry the bottom of the bowl, so that there is no risk of water falling into the melted chocolate. Add the remaining chocolate in large pieces. Stir constantly to melt and incorporate the remaining chocolate. This process should take between 5 and 10 minutes.\nTo bring the chocolate into a completely tempered state, reheat it repeatedly over the same pan of hot water for no more than 2 or 3 seconds at a time, until it reaches a temperature of 87 to 91 degrees F for bittersweet or semisweet chocolate or 84 to 88 degrees for milk or white chocolate.\nCheck the temperature of the chocolate after each heating, to prevent overheating it. If the temperature rises above 91 degrees F, the chocolate goes out of temper and you must start the process from the beginning.\nTemperature is an important part of tempering and a good thermometer makes the process a lot easier. Bear in mind the temperatures in the chart below when tempering chocolate.\nTemperature Chart: 110 to 120 degrees F: The chocolate should be melted to this temperature before tempering. The chocolate should be cooled by adding finely cut chocolate to begin restabilizing the crystals.\n87 to 91 degrees F: The chocolate should be elevated to this temperature to be in temper for bittersweet and semisweet chocolates.\n84 to 88 degrees F: The chocolate should be elevated to this temperature to be in temper for milk and white chocolates.\nWhen you melt chocolate, the crystals in the cocoa butter dissolve and become unstable. If the chocolate sets again after being melted, the cocoa butter rises to the surface and forms a gray film. To prevent this, you need to temper the chocolate so the crystals become stable and the chocolate sets with a good texture and sheen. To make any number of chocolate decorations, cutouts or fine piping done on paper and transferred, it is important to temper the chocolate.\nThere are several different methods for tempering, all of which are geared toward restabilizing the crystals of cocoa butter so the chocolate returns to the same state it was in before melting.
