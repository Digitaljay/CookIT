Set dough aside, let rest until no longer elastic, 30 to 45 minutes.\nDivide dough in 1/2. Working with 1 piece of dough, roll into a 10-inch round, about 1/4-inch thick. Place on pizza peel fold 1-inch dough over forming an edge all the way around. Drizzle with 2 teaspoons olive oil and spread with 1/4 cup olive paste. Add 1/2 of the onions in an even layer and scatter with 1/3 olives and 1/3 cup goat cheese. Season with pepper. Place 3 to 4 anchovies on the top of the tart.

Place 2 balls on each sheet and cover with a damp towel. Allow the dough to rise in a warm spot until they have doubled in size, about 2 hours.\nTo roll out the dough; dab your fingers in flour and then place 1 ball on a generously floured work surface. Press down the center of each ball with the tips of your fingers, stretching the dough out with your hand. When the dough has doubled in width, using a floured rolling pin, roll the dough out until it is very thin, like a flatbread. The outer border should be slightly thicker than the center. Transfer the dough with a spatula or the back of a knife, allowing it to fold up almost like an umbrella, to a paddle. Do not worry that the pizza is not round, you are looking for an 8 to 10-inch shape, a cross between an oval and a rectangle. If you get a hole, simply pinch the edges back together.

Insert a probe thermometer into the thigh, near the hip joint. Place the turkey, uncovered, back in the oven. Continue roasting, basting or brushing with the juices in the pan every 30 minutes, until the thermometer registers 165 degrees F and the juices are no longer pink. This will take about another 10 minutes per pound (about 2 1/2 hours for a 15-pound turkey and 3 to 3 1/2 hours for a 20-pound turkey). Remove the turkey from the oven and cover lightly with foil until you are ready to carve. Pour the pan drippings into a fat separator and set aside for gravy.\nMaple-Whiskey Gravy\nPlace the giblets and neck in a small saucepan of water over medium heat and bring to a boil. Turn the heat to medium low and simmer 45 minutes to 1 hour, until the giblets are cooked. Remove the giblets, set aside and keep the water in the saucepan.\nIn the turkey roasting pan (which should not have been cleaned!), add the turkey fat. Sprinkle in the flour and whisk into the fat to form a paste. If the paste is too thick or clumpy, add a little more fat. If it's too greasy, sprinkle in more flour. Whisk and cook the roux over medium-low heat until it is deep golden brown.\nPour in the chicken broth, whiskey and maple syrup, whisking the whole time. Allow the gravy to cook and thicken for several minutes, whisking occasionally. If it gets too thick or if it's too salty, thin it with a little giblet water. If the gravy is too thin, keep cooking it until it thickens up.\nTaste, then add salt and plenty of pepper. Chop the giblets and add them in, if you like. Remove as much of the neck meat as you can and add it to the gravy.
