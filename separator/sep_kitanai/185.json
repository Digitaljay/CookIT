While it rests, make the pan gravy.\nUntie the legs of the chicken. Remove the lemon, garlic, and herbs from the cavity of the chicken; discard. Place the chicken on a serving platter breast side up, and, using a sharp knife, carve the bird; use a large fork to pull 1 of the legs away from the body.

Evenly and generously coat the duck pieces with the salt mixture and arrange them in a single layer in the pan, tucking them into the salt mixture. Refrigerate uncovered overnight. Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Rinse the duck and pat it dry. Arrange the duck pieces in a single layer in a large, heavy pot (such as an oval Dutch oven) or a heavy roasting pan with sides that are at least 4 inches deep. Melt the duck fat over low heat and pour it over the duck. The pieces must be submerged. Bake until the meat is spoon tender, but not falling off the bone, about 2 1/2 hours.\nTo use the duck at once, remove it from the fat and set it and the fat aside to cool to room temperature. Pick the duck meat from the bones, trying to keep the meat in large pieces. Discard the bones and skin. Use now or cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days. Transfer the fat to an airtight container and refrigerate until solid. Discard the layer of solidified cooking juices at the bottom of the container and refrigerate the remaining fat for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 3 months. (For longer storage, leave the duck on the bone and submerged in the fat. Cool to room temperature and then cover and refrigerate for up to 1 week. When ready to use, reheat in a 250 degree F oven until the fat is liquid and the duck is just warm.)\nTo prepare the dumplings, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Pierce the potatoes in several places with a fork and bake until tender, about 1 hour. Set aside until cool enough. While the potatoes are still warm, fold in the eggs and salt. Stir in 3/4 cup flour and then add the remaining flour a little at a time until the mixture resembles soft biscuit dough. The dough should be a little sticky, although when poked with a fingertip the dimple should not close up. To test the dough, bring a small saucepan of salted water to a simmer. Break off a 3/4 inch square piece of dough and drop it into the water. If the dumpling breaks apart in the water, add a little more flour to the dough. Pour the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and cut into 4 equal pieces. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly dust it with flour. Working with one piece at a time, roll the dough into a 3/4-inch-thick rope. Cut each rope crosswise into bite-size lengths, 1 to 1 1/2 inches. Roll each piece on a gnocchi board or the back of the tines of a fork to ridge them lightly, if you wish. (The ridges help the dumplings hold the delicious broth.) Spread the dumplings onto the prepared baking sheet.\nBring a large pot of water to a simmer. Salt generously. Set a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet and place them next to the stove. Add half of the dumplings to the boiling water and cook them until they float. Use a wire skimmer to transfer them to the wire rack. Cook the remaining dumplings. The dumplings can be used now as part of the finished dish, or they can be stored to use later.\nTo store them, refrigerate the dumplings on the wire rack until chilled. Toss the cold dumplings with enough oil to keep them moist (to prevent sticking). Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 2 days. To poach the eggs, fill a large skillet with water to a depth of 2 inches. Add the vinegar and bring to a simmer. Prepare a large bowl of very cold water. Break 1 egg into a small bowl or cup and slide the egg into the simmering water. Repeat with each remaining egg, spacing them evenly in the skillet; cook them in 2 batches if necessary. Poach at a bare simmer until the whites are firm but the yolks are still runny, about 2 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the eggs to the cold water, taking care to not break the yolks. Use at once or refrigerate until ready to assemble the dish, up to 1 day. Set the skillet of water aside.\nTo assemble the dish, in a very large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the duck fat over medium-high heat until shimmering hot. Add half the dumplings and cook until they are golden brown on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of duck fat and cook the other half of the dumplings. Return all of the dumplings to the skillet. Add the duck and the chicken stock and cook over medium-high heat until the duck is warmed through, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with the pepper and taste for salt. Meanwhile, bring the water used to poach the eggs back to a bare simmer. Divide the duck, dumplings, and broth among 6 warmed shallow bowls.

Trim corners, fold bottom pastry over, and press tightly to seal. Gather the scraps. Roll again, and cut into decorative shapes. Brush with ice water, and attach to coulibiac as desired. In a small bowl, whisk together egg yolks and cream. Brush the surface of the coulibiac with egg-yolk mixture. (The coulibiac can be refrigerated at this point up to 3 or 4 hours.) Using a small paring knife, cut a circle, about 1/2-inch in diameter, out of the top center of the coulibiac to allow steam to escape. Bake until puffed and golden brown, about 30 minutes. Let cool slightly before slicing into serving pieces. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan over low heat, melt 8 tablespoons butter. Remove from heat, and add 2 tablespoons lemon juice. Spoon over sliced coulibiac as desired.;\nStep 1. In the bowl of a food processor or using the flat paddle of an electric mixer, mix 1/2 cup flour with butter until very smooth. Shape the mixture into a flat square 1 inch thick, wrap well in plastic, and chill for at least 30 minutes. Step 2. Combine salt with the remaining flour in a large mixing bowl, and add cream (or cream and water). Mix the dough well by hand or with an electric mixer; the dough will not be completely smooth but it should not be sticky. Shape it into a flat square 1 1/2 inches thick, wrap in plastic, and chill, at least 30 minutes. Step 3. Remove the flour dough from the refrigerator. On a lightly floured board, roll the dough into a rectangle twice as long as the butter dough. Place the butter dough in the center, fold up the ends to completely encase the butter dough, and seal the edges by pinching them together. Wrap well in plastic, and chill for at least 30 minutes, so that the dough achieves the same temperature throughout. Step 4. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and, on a lightly floured board, roll it out into a large rectangle approximately 1/2 inch thick. Fold the dough into thirds, aligning the edges carefully and brushing off any excess flour. The object is to ensure that the butter is distributed evenly throughout, so that the pastry will puff evenly when baked. Wrap the dough, and chill it for at least 30 minutes. This completes 1 turn. Step 4 should be repeated 5 more times; classic puff pastry gets 6 turns, creating hundreds of layers of butter between layers of the flour dough (729 to be exact). Use as little flour as possible when rolling out the dough, and always brush of any excess. Remember to let the dough rest for at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator between turns, or 15 minutes in the freezer. This chilling makes the rolling out much easier, and it keeps the layers of butter of equal thickness. By the 6th and final turn, the dough should be very smooth, with no lumps of butter visible. Wrap the pastry in plastic wrap, and refrigerate until ready to use (up to 2 days), or freeze for future use.\nYield: approximately 2 pounds", "ingredients": ["2 cups white wine", "2 celery stalks, cut into 1-inch lengths", "2 cups celery leaves", "2 carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch lengths", "1 teaspoon black peppercorns", "4 to 5 bay leaves, preferably fresh", "1 (4 pound) salmon fillet, boned and skinned", "1 (4-ounce) package Japanese cellophane noodles", "10 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus 8 tablespoons, melted, for serving, and more for buttering pan", "1 tablespoon canola oil", "4 leeks, cleaned and thinly sliced, white parts only", "1/2 cup chopped fresh dill", "Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper", "12 ounces mushrooms, sliced, such as shiitake or white button", "2 hard-boiled eggs, coarsely chopped", "Cayenne pepper, to taste", "1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice, plus 2 tablespoons, for serving", "2 pounds Puff Pastry, chilled, recipe follows", "2 large egg yolks", "2 tablespoons heavy cream", "1 pound all-purpose flour, accurately weighed", "1 pound (4 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces", "1 teaspoon salt", "1 cup heavy cream (or 1/2 cup heavy cream mixed with 1/2 cup ice water)"], "title": "Coulibiac with Ariadne", "picture_link": null}, "55447": {"instructions": "Put the stock in a saucepan and sprinkle over the gelatin.
